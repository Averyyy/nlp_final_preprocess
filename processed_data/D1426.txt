Video game[edit]
In May 2011, prior to first-season episodes of My Babysitter's a Vampire airing on Disney Channel in the United States, and after certain episodes aired as sneak peeks on Teletoon/T l toon (in Canada); Secret Location, with support from the Bell Broadcast and New Media Fund, began developing a video game for Teletoon and MBAV called "Humans vs. Vampires in 3D".[3] Humans vs. Vampires is a modern spin on classic arcade-style games like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. In this badge system game, the user can play as either a human or a vampire, using over 30 battle moves to defy their opponent, including three special moves unique to each character. Each character has over 30 moves plus three special moves, players battle their way through five levels and five different opponents, with rivals getting increasingly more difficult to beat as the game progresses. The points that are scored get counted toward the overall site tally, which affect the outcome of the season finale.[44][45][46]
A testing session for the game took place in Toronto, Ontario, CA on Sunday, June 5, 2011,[44] before the game officially launched on the official website on October 14, 2011.[47] In February 2012, popular game site Kongregate added Humans vs. Vampires to their website.[48] Based on the final scores for each team, an extra scene was aired after the season one finale on Teletoon that was not aired on Disney Channel (the original episode remained unaltered).[10][11]
Between July 27 and July 31, 2012, another testing session for Humans vs. Vampires took place in Toronto for an iOS App release for mobile devices to play the game.[49] In the mobile version, Ethan's sister Jane and a character from season 2 named Boltz are added to the game. It's optimized for the fourth generation iPod touch, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S.[50]
The game is free to download in the App Store under the title "Humans VS Vampires". A one-time 99 cent in-app upgrade allows players to unlock all five good guys and five undead characters.[46] The game has been nominated for a Digi and Kidscreen Award,[29][32] and won a Canadian Screen Award for Best Cross-Platform Project in Children's and Youth.[34]
