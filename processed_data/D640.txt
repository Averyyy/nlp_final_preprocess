Her studio albums include two back-to-back albums that were certified gold; these were Tails and Firecracker.[4]
Loeb's film, television and voice-over work includes guest starring roles in the season finale of Gossip Girl, and two episodes, including the series finale, of Netflix's Fuller House. She also starred in two other television series, Dweezil & Lisa, a weekly culinary adventure for the Food Network[5] that featured her alongside Dweezil Zappa, and Number 1 Single on E! Entertainment Television.[6] She has also acted in such films as House on Haunted Hill, Fright Night,[7] Hot Tub Time Machine 2,[8] and Helicopter Mom.[9]
Loeb has released children's CDs and books; her 2016 children's CD Feel What U Feel won Best Children's Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. Loeb's latest album, A Simple Trick to Happiness, was released in February 2020.
In addition, she has a line of eyewear, and started a non-profit organization that sends under-served children to camp, funded by Loeb's own organic and fair trade coffee, Wake Up! Brew.
Early life and education[edit]
Lisa Loeb was born to a Jewish[10] family in Bethesda, Maryland,[11] and was raised in Dallas, Texas,[12] where her parents still reside. Her mother, Gail, was the president of the Dallas County Medical Society Alliance and Foundation, and her father, Peter Loeb, was a gastroenterologist.[13] She has a younger sister, songwriter Debbie Loeb. As a child, Lisa studied piano, but later switched to guitar.[3] She attended The Hockaday School, an all-girls private school. For two years, she had her own radio show on 88.5 KRSM-FM, a 10-watt station licensed to the nearby all-boys St. Marks School of Texas.[14] After graduating from high school in 1986, she attended Brown University, where she graduated in 1990[3] with a degree in comparative literature.[15]
Music career[edit]
Early years and first bands (1980s 1993)[edit]
At Brown in the mid-1980s, Loeb and Elizabeth Mitchell formed a band named Liz and Lisa,[15] with future singer/songwriter and classmate Duncan Sheik as a guitarist. The duo released the albums Liz and Lisa (1989) and Liz and Lisa - Days Were Different (1990) independently.[3] After college, bassist Rick Lassiter and drummer Chad Fischer joined the band.[citation needed] After developing a following together, Loeb and Mitchell parted ways a few years after college.
Loeb attended Berklee College of Music in Boston for a session of summer school, and in 1990 formed a full band called Nine Stories. The band, which was named after the book by J.D. Salinger, included Tim Bright on guitar, Jonathan Feinberg on drums, and Joe Quigley on bass. Loeb began working with producer Juan Pati o to make the cassette Purple Tape in 1992.[3] It included the earliest recordings of later popular tracks such as "Do You Sleep?", "Snow Day", "Train Songs", and "It's Over".[15][16] Loeb sold the violet-colored cassette to fans at gigs and used it as a sonic calling card to industry gatekeepers.[3] She and her band made a recording of her song "Stay (I Missed You)" during the same period.[17]
Loeb developed a following from her solo acoustic performances on the New York City coffeehouse circuit and the rock club circuit. She travelled to cities such as Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Dallas, but focused mainly on New York City. She played acoustically and with her band in folk and rock clubs, including at CBGB. Loeb performed at music festivals such as the New Music Seminar and South by Southwest.[3]
"Stay (I Missed You)" (1994)[edit]
Main article: Stay (I Missed You)
Loeb's big break came through her friendship with actor Ethan Hawke,[14] who lived in an apartment across the street from her in New York City. She told Cosmopolitan that she met Hawke in the NYC theater community where, as she phrased it, "I made music for his plays".[18] Loeb gave Hawke the Juan Pati o-produced version of "Stay (I Missed You);"[14] he in turn gave it to director Ben Stiller during the making of the 1994 film Reality Bites. Stiller subsequently decided to use the song in the film's ending credits,[14] and it was included by Ron Fair on the soundtrack on RCA Records.[3] Hawke directed a rare one-take video on film, a continuous steadicam shot operated by Robin Buerki.[citation needed]
"Stay (I Missed You)" went on to become a number one hit on the American charts.[19] When her song hit number one, Loeb earned the distinction of being the first artist to top the Hot 100 before being signed to any record label.[3] The single reached Gold status on July 12, 1994, just over three months after its release date.[20] Loeb and Nine Stories received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Group, and were named Best International Newcomer in the Brit Awards.[3]
In 2019, Loeb released a limited edition 12" red vinyl pressing of the song for the 25th anniversary of the song. The release included four unreleased versions of "Stay (I Missed You)", "Truthfully", "Waiting for Wednesday", and "I Do", recorded live in January 2013 in Japan.
Loeb appeared at the 25th anniversary screening of Reality Bites at the Tribeca Film Festival, with the film's stars Ethan Hawke, Winona Ryder, Ben Stiller, and Janeane Garofalo, and performed "Stay (I Missed You)" during the film's end credits.[citation needed]
Tails and Firecracker (1995 1999)[edit]
Main articles: Tails (album) and Firecracker (Lisa Loeb album)
In September 1995, Loeb's debut album, Tails, credited to Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories, was released on Geffen Records. The album was co-produced by Juan Pati o, her then longtime boyfriend.[21] "Stay" was included on the album, and Loeb managed a top 20 hit with "Do You Sleep?" and two moderately successful radio hits with "Taffy" and "Waiting for Wednesday". The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on December 1, 1995.[20] Critics were favorable to the album, with Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, in particular, noting, "Loeb has an undeniable gift for creating an air of intimacy and vulnerability, which may well be enough for 'Stay' fans looking for additional doses of contemplative melancholy".[21][22]
After the release of Tails Tim Bright and Jonathan Feinberg left Nine Stories and were replaced with Mark Spencer and Ronny Crawford respectively.[citation needed]
In 1997, Loeb released a second major-label album on Geffen, Firecracker, and began experimenting more with orchestrations done with Dan Coleman. At this point, Loeb started going under her own name for the albums instead of using the band name, although she still continued to tour worldwide with Nine Stories, as well as acoustically as she had done from the start.[citation needed] Firecracker included hit singles such as "I Do", which received radio success, peaking at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and music television.[citation needed] The album was certified Gold on June 10, 2008.[20] She subsequently toured with The Wallflowers and Chris Isaak, and performed at Lilith Fair.[3]
Guest appearances (2000 2001)[edit]
In 2000, Loeb participated in the Ozzy Osbourne tribute album Bat Head Soup, performing "Goodbye to Romance" with Dweezil Zappa on guitar. She contributed to An All Star Tribute To Cher with "Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves", and to An All Star Tribute To Shania Twain with "Don't Be Stupid", both of which were released in 2005. Other international work includes Loeb's guest performance on the song "Anti-Hero" for an all-female Japanese musical group Rin''s album Inland Sea.[23] Loeb contributed vocals to New Found Glory's cover of "Stay", from their 2007 LP From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II, as well as performing the song live with the band.[24]
Beginning with Reality Bites, Loeb's music has been featured in several soundtracks. The single "How" was included on the soundtracks for films Twister and Jack Frost, and was heard in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode "Homecoming". "We Could Still Belong Together" earned a spot on the Legally Blonde soundtrack in 2001, while "I Wish" can be heard on the soundtrack for Anywhere But Here (1999).

Main articles: Cake and Pie and Hello Lisa
Cake and Pie, Loeb's third album and debut for A&M/Interscope, was released in 2002.

It peaked at 199 on the Billboard Charts.[25]
In mid-2002, Loeb signed a deal with Artemis Records, a new boutique label run by record company veterans Danny Goldberg and Daniel Glass, after Interscope allowed her to buy the rights to her masters. Artemis had offered to re-release the record with more promotion. With new artwork, some songs added and some removed, Cake and Pie was re-launched as Hello Lisa, a play on Sanrio's signature Hello Kitty, who appears on the album cover wearing Lisa Loeb's trademark glasses.[3]
She released an EP with just the new songs on it, as well as an alternative version of the song "Underdog" for fans who had already purchased the Cake and Pie CD. She co-directed a video with Dweezil Zappa for "Underdog" co-starring Hello Kitty playing guitar. Loeb toured the world again, making special stops in Sanrio stores for in-store autographs while appearing with Hello Kitty at the Japanese MTV Music Awards.

In 2004, Loeb signed to the more experienced and established independent label Zo /Rounder Records. The Way It Really Is was released August 2004 as Loeb's fifth studio-recorded album, based on the song "The Way It Really Is".[26] Although the album was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, critics noted the mature and strong writing by Loeb.[27] Stephen Erlewine called it "the best, most cohesive record she's made, a clean, crisp collection of well-crafted, gentle tunes that slowly, surely work into the subconscious."[26]

The song was put in rotation on SiriusXM among other stations.[33]
Camp Kappawanna, singles (2015 2019)[edit]
She co-wrote the lyrics and co-composed the music to Camp Kappawanna, a family musical that premiered in New York on March 21, 2015, by the Atlantic Theater Company. Other collaborators on the score included Michelle Lewis and Dan Petty. The musical follows "the misadventures of Jennifer Jenkins, an awkward and adorable 12-year-old kid", and was inspired by Loeb's own memories of summer camp. The show received a positive write-up in The New York Times, with the review describing it as "fresh and funny" and praising the acoustic music and characterizations of the campers.[34]
Her song "3, 2, 1, Let Go" was released in April 2015 as a single. Co-written and co-composed with Chris Unck, the song was also used in the April 2015 film Helicopter Mom. Loeb starred in the film as a high school English teacher.[35][9] On November 20, 2015, Loeb released the single "Champagne (I'm Ready)" as a digital download through Amazon.[36] Loeb described the New Year's track as "something you'd probably hear more in a dance club."[37]

A Simple Trick to Happiness (2020), Together Apart[edit]
A Simple Trick to Happiness was released on February 28, 2020.[38] The album is Loeb's most personal and reflects her interest in simple and direct songwriting paired with inspiration from her children and personal life.[39] Loeb was inspired to write positive, uplifting music due to the complexity of modern life and after having written several albums of children's music.[40] In October 2019, Loeb preceded the album's release with the premiere of her single "Sing Out" on the largest LGBTQ news site Queerty, in honor of National Coming Out Day. In December 2019, she premiered the music video for "Skeleton", the first official single from the album.[41]
The album was met by positive from critics. She has subsequently released music videos for many of the tracks on the album, including "This Is My Life", "Another Day", "Sing Out', "For the Birch", "Shine", "The Upside", "Doesn't It Feel Good", "Most Of All", "I Wanna Go First" and "Wonder".[citation needed]

Together Apart[42] evolved out of a Brown Musical Theatre class reunion on Zoom held during the pandemic. The reunion was attended by graduates from the early 80s through the late 90s. Loeb, a  90 Graduate, was energized by the digital reconnection and was inspired to find a solution to everyone s concern about how theater could exist during the pandemic. She began collaborating with her fellow graduates to create Together Apart. Together Apart was intentionally created using the Zoom platform as a reflection of life during the pandemic.
