AT&T Stadium is a retractable-roof stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States. It serves as the home of the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL), and was completed on May 27, 2009.  It is also the home of the Cotton Bowl Classic and the Big 12 Championship Game.  The stadium is one of eleven US venues set to host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The facility, owned by the city of Arlington, can also be used for a variety of other activities, such as concerts, basketball games, soccer, college and high-school football contests, rodeos, motocross, Spartan Races, and professional wrestling. It replaced the partially covered Texas Stadium, which served as the Cowboys' home from 1971 through the 2008 season.
The stadium is widely referred to as Jerry World and The Death Star after Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who originally envisioned it as a large entertainment venue.[16] The stadium can seat around 80,000 people, but can be reconfigured to hold around 100,000 seats[5] making it the largest stadium in the NFL by seating capacity.[17] Additional attendance is made possible by the Party Pass (open areas) sections behind the seats in each end zone which are positioned on a series of six elevated platforms connected by stairways.[17][18]  The record attendance for an NFL regular season game was set in 2009 with a crowd of 105,121.[19] It also has the world's 34th-largest high-definition video screen.
Construction and design[edit]
 Interior of the stadium in 2010
Originally estimated at $650 million, the stadium's actual construction cost rose to $1.15 billion,[20] making it one of the most expensive sports venues ever built. To aid Cowboys owner and general manager, Jerry Jones, in paying the construction costs of the new stadium, Arlington voters approved the increase of the city's sales tax by 0.5%, the hotel occupancy tax by 2%, and car rental tax by 5%. The City of Arlington provided over $325 million (including interest) in bonds as funding,[20][21] and Jones covered any cost overruns. Also, the NFL provided the Cowboys with an additional $150 million loan, following its policy for facilitating financing for the construction of new stadiums.[22]
To prevent the Sun's glare from interfering with any players' eyesight, the vast majority of football fields are oriented north-south instead of east-west.[23] However, AT&T Stadium was built with the field oriented east-west and with large windows on the western side.[24] During afternoon games, this design allows sunlight to come into the stadium at an angle that can interfere with players' vision; some players have complained about this problem.[24]
Lead architect on the design team at HKS Architects for the project was Bryan Trubey, who has stated that the overarching concept for the stadium was "...that this should not be just a stadium, but should almost be built like a civic structure."[25][26]
A pair of nearly 300 ft (91 m)-tall arches spans the length of the stadium dome (one of the tallest domes in the world), anchored to the ground at each end. The new stadium also includes "more than 3,000 Sony LCD displays throughout the luxury suites, concourses, concession areas and more, offering fans viewing options that extend beyond the action on the field".[27] It also houses a center-hung Mitsubishi video display board that was the largest HDTV screen in the world at the time of their installation.[28] It has since been surpassed in size by the Panasonic "Big Hoss" video board (218 feet (66 m) wide and 94.6 feet (28.8 m) tall) at Texas Motor Speedway.[29] Glass doors, allowing each end zone to be opened, were designed and constructed by Dallas-based Haley-Greer glass systems.
The retractable roof was designed by structural engineering firm Walter P Moore and the systems were implemented by mechanization consultants Uni-Systems. The electrification of Cowboys Stadium's retractable roof was developed by VAHLE, Inc.[30]  These kinetic architecture fundamentals  are employed to create quick conversions of the facility to accommodate a variety of events. When the design was officially unveiled on December 12, 2006, it showed that from inside the stadium, the roof (membrane installed by K Post Company of Dallas)[31] will look very similar to the Texas Stadium roof, with its trademark hole. However, it can be covered by the retractable roof panel to protect against the elements.
The football turf field was built by Hellas Construction, which developed a special SoftTop Convertible Turf system that has 26 interchangeable panels to allow the stadium to host a variety of events from concerts, dirt bike races, and monster truck rallies to college football, basketball, and soccer games.[32]
A Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame is planned for the Hall of Fame level. The drawings also include a site for a large sculpture northeast of the stadium, close to Randol Mill Road. Mayor Robert Cluck claimed to use eminent domain as a last resort, but most of the properties refused to sell to the city, indicating that the incentive program was not adequate according to Glenn Sodd, an attorney representing some homeowners in the area. Attorney Bob Cohen, who is representing some of the property owners, said the city gave many of his clients little incentive to sell. He said he represents the owners of some rental properties who were counting on that monthly revenue for their retirement and said most homeowners cannot afford to rebuild or buy in that area with the incentive package.[33] An Arlington attorney was quoted as saying "The mayor sold out and the council went right along".[34]

 Video of inside the stadium
1994: Cowboys owner Jerry Jones proposed to expand the 65,000-seat Texas Stadium by up to 40,000 seats, add retractable roof panels and install a climate-control system to make the stadium a year-round venue for sporting events, including the Super Bowl, concerts, and conventions.
1997 2000: The Cowboys held preliminary talks with Arlington officials about building a stadium there. The team also publicly discussed a $260 million plan to upgrade Texas Stadium. In 2000, the Cowboys compiled a list of potential stadium sites, which included Grapevine, Coppell, and Arlington. The team continued negotiating with Irving to renovate Texas Stadium.
2001: Jones said Arlington is a leading contender for a $500 million stadium. The primary site considered is the 2,000 acres (810 ha) Lakes of Arlington tract on Farm Road 157. Other cities in the running included Grapevine and Grand Prairie. In October, Jones discussed the new stadium with the mayors of Arlington, Irving, Grapevine, and Dallas.
2003: The Cowboys asked the Irving City Council to extend their lease at Texas Stadium, which was to expire at the end of the 2008 season, on a year-to-year basis. They narrowed their search to sites in Las Colinas and Dallas, and state legislators filed bills that would allow Dallas County to increase its hotel-occupancy and car-rental taxes to pay for a new stadium.
2004: In April, the Cowboys announced plans to build a $650 million stadium at Fair Park in Dallas. The deal required $425 million in public financing from a 3% hotel-occupancy tax and a 6% car-rental tax. The deal fell apart in June when Dallas County commissioners said they cannot justify asking voters to approve the team's request for $425 million in public funding. In July, the Cowboys and Arlington announced they are negotiating to locate the stadium near Globe Life Park (then Ameriquest Field). In August, the Arlington City Council agreed unanimously to put before voters a tax increase that would fund the city's $325 million portion of the project. Voters approved the tax increase on November 2.
2005: Arlington and the Cowboys chose the site south of Randol Mill Road and east of Collins Street for the new stadium. The city began notifying residents and property owners of its plans to acquire their property. The Cowboys hired the HKS architectural firm to design the stadium. Early blueprints showed 414 luxury suites and a two-panel retractable roof. The city completed its sale of $297.9 million in bonds to pay for its portion of the construction. Demolition of houses began November 1.
January 2006: The Cowboys hired Oklahoma-based Manhattan Construction as the general contractor for the stadium and the city completed its land purchases, although it still faced a number of lawsuits over land acquisition. Later that month, Tarrant County work crews began demolition of more than 150 Arlington residences and small-business structures to make room for the stadium.[35]
March 2006: An alliance was announced between Manhattan Construction and two general contractors, Rayco Construction of Grand Prairie and 3i Construction of Dallas, to manage the stadium's construction.[36]
April 2006: Excavation began by Mario Sinacola and Sons Excavating. By August, they had moved over 1.4 million cubic yards (1,100,000 m3) of earth, shaping a 13-to-14-acre (5.3 to 5.7 ha) stadium bowl an average of 54 feet (16 m) deep.[37]
August 2006: Two construction cranes were raised on the site.
October 2006: The grass amphitheater on Randol Mill Road was leveled to make way for the extension of Baird Farm Road.
December 2006: The stadium's structure began to go up, and on December 12, Jerry Jones unveiled the in-depth plans and designs of the stadium to the public.
January 2007: A construction worker was injured in a 20 ft (6 m) fall.[38]
February 2007: Masonry work began.
March 2007: Heldenfels Enterprises was awarded the contract to manufacture and erect the precast/prestressed concrete structural components and placement of them began in April.[39]

It was televised on NBC.[48] This game attracted a record-breaking crowd of 105,121.[19] After the game, Manning signed the wall of the visitor's locker room with the message, "First win in the New Stadium."[49]
September 28, 2009: The Cowboys got their first home regular-season win. They beat the Carolina Panthers 21 7 with 90,588 in attendance. The game was televised on ESPN's Monday Night Football and marked a record 42nd win for the Cowboys on that show.[50]
Naming[edit]
Although the stadium had yet to sell naming rights, many fans started referring to the project with various nicknames such as "Jerry World",[41][51][52] the "Death Star",[53] "The Palace in Dallas" (for which announcer Bob Costas was criticized by the Arlington mayor[54]), "Cowboys Cathedral",[55] "Jerrassic Park" and others.[56] There was also a petition by some fans to have the stadium named after longtime Cowboys' coach Tom Landry.
On May 13, 2009, Jerry Jones announced the official name as Cowboys Stadium.[41]
On July 25, 2013, Jerry Jones announced that the Dallas Cowboys had agreed to grant naming rights to AT&T. The name change from Cowboys Stadium to AT&T Stadium took effect immediately.[57] The sponsorship deal was reported to be worth about $17 19 million per year.[58] Facility Solutions Group installed the "AT&T Stadium" letters on the top of the stadium. Signage includes two sets of letters 43 feet (13 m) tall stretching 385 feet (117 m). The letters are made of lightweight components and aluminum and are insulated and heated to melt ice and snow.[59]
This is AT&T's third major sports venue where it holds the naming rights. The others are AT&T Center in San Antonio, and Jones AT&T Stadium in Lubbock.
Video board[edit]
 The video board at the stadium in 2022.
Guinness World Records was on hand at the September 28, 2009, game against the Carolina Panthers to award certificates to the chairman of Mitsubishi Electric and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for the world's largest HD video display.[28] For basketball events played in Cowboys Stadium, such as the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, the video board is actually larger than the court. It has since been surpassed in size by the screen at Charlotte Motor Speedway[60][61] and the video boards at TIAA Bank Field.[citation needed]
During the debut preseason game of Cowboys Stadium on August 21, 2009, a punt by Tennessee Titans punter A. J. Trapasso hit the 175 feet (58 yd) wide screen above the field. The punt deflected backwards and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. By rule, the down was replayed. Jerry Jones believes that Trapasso was trying to hit the scoreboard, saying, "If you look at how you punt the football, unless you're trying to hit the scoreboard, you punt the ball to get downfield. You certainly want to get some hangtime, but you punt the ball to get downfield, and you sure don't punt the ball down the middle. You punt it off to the side."[62] Whether the screen would affect an opposing team's punting strategy has been debated. For teams with strategies centered on maximizing hang time, physicist Christopher Moore of Longwood University has shown via computer simulation that well-kicked punts have the potential to hit the screen no matter the field position.[63] Trapasso disputed Jones' suggestion that he was intentionally trying to hit the board, and other NFL punters have suggested that the board may pose a problem for longer hang-time punts. The screen was retrofitted with 16 custom winches using 11,000 feet (3,400 m) of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) domestic galvanized wire rope to transport the video board in time to make room for U2's massive set during their 360  Tour, and was moved back down after the concert.[citation needed] The video board is also the primary attachment point for up to 370,000 pounds (170,000 kg) of concert and theatrical rigging.[citation needed]
On August 24, 2013, during a preseason game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Cowboys punter Chris Jones became the second player to hit the scoreboard. He conceded a touchdown on the rekick.[64]
On January 16, 2022, during the Cowboys' Wild Card playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, Cowboys punter Bryan Anger became the third player to hit the video board with a kick in the third quarter, and the first to do so in the postseason. This prompted referee Alex Kemp to explain the necessitated rekick by rule to the crowd.[65]
On September 11, 2022, Tampa Bay Buccaneers punter Jake Camarda hit the video board, becoming the fourth punter to do so.
Major events[edit]
NBA All-Star Weekend[edit]
On February 14, 2010, the stadium hosted the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. With an announced crowd of 108,713, the game became the highest-attended basketball game in history, setting a new Guinness World Record. The East squad prevailed with a 141 139 victory over the West.[66]
NFL[edit]
 Cowboys playing at the stadium
On January 3, 2010, the Cowboys defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in a 24 0 shutout to win the NFC East division title and complete the first ever back-to-back shutouts in franchise history.[67]
On January 9, 2010, the Cowboys hosted their first playoff game in the new stadium, again playing the Eagles. Dallas won 34 14, breaking their infamous 13-year playoff win drought.
On February 6, 2011, the stadium hosted Super Bowl XLV in which the Green Bay Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31 25. Others bidding for the game's location were the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona and Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana.[68] The Cowboys attempted to increase its capacity to 105,000 seats in hopes of setting the record for attendance at a Super Bowl. In a last-minute rush to add seats during one of the area's notorious ice storms, 7 construction workers were injured by ice sliding off of the stadium roof.[69] Hours before kickoff, over 1,200 seats were blocked off in the interest of safety; according to a police officer in the affected area, the seats hadn't been finished in time for the fire marshal to inspect them.[70] Approximately 800 people were given other seats inside the stadium, thus costing the NFL any chance of setting the Super Bowl attendance record (the final figure of 103,219 came 766 short of the record set in Super Bowl XIV). However, about 400 people were unable to be seated and were given a letter from the NFL that could be exchanged for three times the face value of the ticket. Those people were also given the option to either watch on a TV in one of the stadium's lounges, where they would be unable to see the field in person, or watch on screens outside the stadium. The NFL also announced that those 400 people would receive free tickets to the next year's Super Bowl. On February 9, 2011, the first lawsuit was filed against the NFL and Jerry Jones.[71] In 2018, the stadium hosted the 2018 NFL Draft.

AT&T Stadium was the site of the 2009 and 2010 Big 12 Championship Games, the last two held prior to the 2010 13 Big 12 Conference realignment. On December 5, 2009, the Texas Longhorns defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers 13 12 in the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game, the first to be held in the stadium with attendance announced at 76,211.[72] The following year, on December 4, 2010,  the Oklahoma Sooners and Nebraska Cornhuskers rekindled their rivalry as the Sooners won 23 20 in the final Big 12 Championship game until the 2017 season. The stadium was scheduled to host the games through the 2013 season, but the realignment of the Big 12 Conference to 10 teams meant they were not allowed to host a championship game because of NCAA rules requiring conferences to have at least 12 teams divided into two divisions in order to stage a championship game.[73][74] However, the NCAA would later change its rules and allow a conference championship game regardless of the number of members of said conference.
Cotton Bowl Classic[edit]

Southwest Classic[edit]
Main article: Arkansas Texas A&M football rivalry
The Arkansas Razorbacks vs. Texas A&M Aggies football rivalry, which began in 1903, was renewed in 2009 as the Southwest Classic, and was played at Cowboys Stadium from 2009 through 2011. In 2012, Texas A&M joined Arkansas in the Southeastern Conference, and the series reverted to the schools' home fields, Kyle Field in College Station, Texas for the 2012 game and Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Arkansas in 2013. The Southwest Classic returned to AT&T Stadium in 2014 and will remain there through at least 2024.

Former Pizza Hut President Michael Rawlings will run the company from its new headquarters in Newark, New Jersey. The company was also backed by Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs and Dallas private equity firm CIC Partners LP.[123][124][125]
Art collection[edit]

Transportation[edit]
Parking[edit]
 Parking at AT&T Stadium for a Dallas Cowboys game in 2022.
The fees for premium parking at Dallas Cowboys games are estimated at $75 per game, based on season ticket holder parking charges.[130] The fees to park at major concerts and other sporting events will be nearly $40 per space at the new stadium.[131] A shuttle operates between the T&P Station and AT&T Stadium for all Cowboys regular season and postseason games and selected college football games,[132] which averages approximately 900 riders per game.[132]  For special events like Super Bowl XLV parking prices can increase to as much as $990.[133]
Public transit[edit]
The stadium was only accessible via the Metro Arlington Xpress (MAX) bus system; a 0.4 mi (0.64 km) walk from the Collins and Andrews stop which connected with the Trinity Rail Express (TRE) station at CentrePort/DFW Airport. The bus system was an experimental program which commenced in April 2013 and was replaced by a ride-sharing service in December 2017.
