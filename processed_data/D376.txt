The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD or LA City Fire) provides firefighting and emergency medical services to the city of Los Angeles, California, United States.[6] The LAFD is responsible for approximately 4 million people who live in the agency's 471 square miles (1,220 km2) jurisdiction.[7] The Los Angeles Fire Department was founded in 1886 and is the third largest municipal fire department in the United States, after the New York City Fire Department and the Chicago Fire Department. The department may be unofficially referred to as the Los Angeles City Fire Department or "LA City Fire" to distinguish it from the Los Angeles County Fire Department which serves the county and whose name may directly confuse people, as the county seat is the city. Another possible reason is that the city and the unincorporated county are often bordering each other and thus the two appear to be serving the same area. The department is currently under the command of chief Kristin Crowley.
History[edit]
 LAFD on the scene of a fire in the Bradbury Building, Downtown Los Angeles in 1947.
The Los Angeles Fire Department has it origins in the year 1871.[8][9][10] In September of that year, George M. Fall, the County Clerk for Los Angeles County organized Engine Company No. 1. It was a volunteer firefighting force with an Amoskeag fire engine and a hose jumper (cart). The equipment was hand-drawn to fires. In the spring of 1874, the fire company asked the Los Angeles City Council to purchase horses to pull the engine. The Council refused and the fire company disbanded.[11]
Many of the former members of Engine Company No. 1 reorganized under the name of Thirty-Eights No. 1 in May 1875, Engine Co. No. 2 was organized under the name Confidence Engine Company.[11]
Los Angeles acquired its first "hook and ladder" truck for the Thirty-Eights. It proved to be too cumbersome and was ill-adapted to the needs of the city. It was sold to the city of Wilmington. In 1876, another "hook and ladder" truck was purchased, serving in the city until 1881.[11]
In 1878, a third fire company was formed by the residents in the neighborhood of Sixth Street and Park. It was given the name of "Park Hose Co. No. 1".  East Los Angeles formed a hose company named "East Los Angeles Hose Co. No. 2" five years later. The final volunteer company was formed in the fall of 1883 in the Morris Vineyard area. This company was called "Morris Vineyard Hose Co. No.3."[11]
All of these companies remained in service until February 1, 1886, when the present paid fire department came into existence.[11]
In 1877, the first horses were bought for the city fire department. The department would continue to use horses for its equipment for almost fifty years, phasing out the last horse drawn equipment on July 19, 1921.[12]
By 1900, the department had grown to 18 fire stations with 123 full-time paid firefighters and 80 fire horses.[12]  The city had also installed 194 fire-alarm boxes allowing civilians to sound the alarm if a fire was spotted. 660 fire hydrants were placed throughout the city, giving firefighters access to a reliable water source.[13] In 1955 Station 78 in Studio City became the first racially integrated station in the department.[14]
Since 1978 the LAFD has provided emergency medical and fire suppression services to the city of San Fernando by contract .[15]
In responses to the 2020 pandemic, the LAFD has helped to administrate the COVID-19 vaccine to residents from Los Angeles. Also, more than 1,800 Los Angeles firefighters have received the COVID-19 vaccine.[16][17]
In 2022, Kristin Crowley became the first female, and the first openly gay, chief of the LAFD.[18]

Types of apparatus[edit]
The department utilizes a wide array of apparatus and equipment. These are most but not all of the apparatus.
Triple combination engines[edit]
 LAFD Engine Co. 11 responding to an emergency call.The triple combination fire engine or  triple  (as it is commonly called) is the most common type of firefighting apparatus in Los Angeles. The term  triple combination  refers to the apparatus having three components; water tank, high capacity water pump, and hose. The triple can be found as a one-piece engine company or as two engines assigned to a Task Force station. The  triples  used by the LAFD have a direct drive, dual centrifuge main pump rated at 1,500 GPM at 150 psi with a 10-foot lift through a 6-inch suction. These apparatus carry a combination of  all of the following sizes of hose; 4 , 21 2 , 1 3/4 , 1 1/2  and 1 . The standard hose load is 750' of 4", 750' of 2 1/2" with a 325GPM nozzle, 400' of 1 3/4" with a 200 GPM nozzle, 400' of 1 1/2" with a 125 GPM nozzle and 500' of 1" with a dual gallonage 10/40 GPM nozzle. The water tank carrying capacity of all LAFD engines is 500 gallons. All frontline engines are equipped with a 30-gallon Class A foam injection system with the exception of Engine 51 at LAX that carries Class B foam in the onboard system. These apparatus are staffed by four members, including a captain who is the company commander, an engineer responsible for driving, maintaining and operating the pump, and two firefighters. A number of triples in the LAFD are also paramedic assessment companies   meaning they include a firefighter/paramedic as part of the crew. All engines are equipped with fire suppression gear as well as basic rescue equipment and emergency medical services equipment.
Light Forces and Task Forces[edit]
 LAFD on the scene of a Major Emergency Structure Fire
The LAFD uses the concept of Light Forces and Task Forces which can be considered one "Resource", although comprising more than one unit or company.[20]
A Light Force is composed of a Pump Engine (200 Series, for example Engine 201 or Engine 301 for 100 stations) and a Ladder Truck.[21] Light forces will almost always respond together as one unit or resource.[20]
A Task Force is simply a Light Force coupled with an Engine. An Engine Company is considered a single unit or "resource" when responding to incidents on its own.[21] A Task Force usually responds to larger incidents, such as structural fires, and is made up of an Engine, a 200 Series Engine (Pump), and a Truck, all operating together. While a standard Engine is always staffed with a full crew, a 200 Series Engine (Pump)is only staffed by a driver (and one other firefighter if responding as part of a Light Force). The purpose of the 200 Series Engine (Pump) is to provide support and equipment to the Truck in a Light Force, and either the Truck Company or the Engine Company in a Task Force.[20]
Rescue Ambulances[edit]
 Rescue Ambulance 11 responding to a call near MacArthur Park
Rescue Ambulances (RAs), often called 'rescues' for short, can be considered either advanced life support (ALS), or basic life support (BLS) units. Ambulances number 1-112 are frontline ALS staffed by 2 firefighter / paramedics, while those in the 200 series are ALS reserves.[22] Ambulances in the 800s & 900s are BLS staffed by 2 firefighter EMTs, with 900-series units assigned to Stations identified numerically over 100.[22]
Helicopters[edit]
 LAFD Bell 412 (retired)
The Air Operations Section of the LAFD operates out of Fire Station 114 at Van Nuys Airport. The station houses six helicopters available for both aerial firefighting and air medical services.[23]FIRE 1, FIRE 2, FIRE 3, FIRE 4, and FIRE 5 are all AgustaWestland AW139s.[24][25][26][27] The final helicopter, FIRE 6, is a Bell 206B.[28]
The department previously operated Bell 205 and Bell 412 types, the last of which were retired by 2017 to make way for the newer AW139s.[29]
Fireboats[edit]
Further information: Warner L. Lawrence
 LAFD Fireboat 2, the Warner Lawrence
The Port of Los Angeles is under the jurisdiction of the LAFD which operates 5 fireboats to provide fire protection for ships and dockside structures.[30] Fireboat 1, Fireboat 3 and Fireboat 5 are identical 39-foot (12 m) long aluminum fireboats capable of a top speed of 29 knots (33 mph; 54 km/h) while fully loaded.[31] They are equipped with a 2,400 US gal/min (9,100 L/min) pump and a 1,000 US gal/min (3,800 L/min) deluge gun.[31] They also have a 50-US-gallon (190 L) firefighting foam capacity.
Fireboat 4, also known as the Bethel F. Gifford, was commissioned in 1962 and is the oldest of the fleet. It is capable of pumping water at 9,000 US gal/min (34,000 L/min) and carries 550 US gallons (2,082 L) of foam solution for petrochemical fires.[32]  It is equipped with jet-stream nozzles to allow for increased maneuverability.[32]
The newest and most technologically advanced of the fireboats is the 105-foot (32 m) long Fireboat 2, also known as the Warner Lawrence, which has the capability to pump up to 38,000 US gallons per minute (140,000 L/min) up to 400 feet (120 m) in the air.[33]  Boat 2 also has an onboard area for treatment and care of rescued persons.[34]
USAR Task Force 1[edit]
Main article: Urban Search and Rescue California Task Force 1
The Los Angeles Fire Department is the founding member of one of California's eight FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces.[35] California Task Force 1 (CA-TF1) is available to respond to natural or man-made disasters around the country and world and assist with search and rescue, medical support, damage assessment and communications.[36]
Stations and apparatus[edit]

The LAFD is divided into four operational Bureaus: Operations Central Bureau (OCB), Operations West Bureau (OWB), Operations South Bureau (OSB); formerly known as 'South Division', and Operations Valley Bureau (OVB); formerly known as 'North Division'. Each Bureau is commanded by a Deputy Chief, who holds the title of 'Bureau Commander'. Each Bureau also has an Assistant Chief serves as the 'Assistant Bureau Commander'. To replicate the former North and South Division, OCB and OVB also have three additional Assistant Chiefs who work 24-hour platoon duty. These Assistant Chiefs staff marked Dodge RAM SUVs and respond to major incidents - Command 22 for OCB and Command 42 of OVB.
Operations Central Bureau compromises of 3 battalions and 22 Fire Stations. Battalion 1 (8 Fire Stations), Battalion 2 (8 Fire Stations) and Battalion 11 (6 Fire Stations). OCB's headquarters is at Fire Station 3.
Operations West Bureau compromises of 3 battalions and 21 Fire Stations. Battalion 4 (7 Fire Stations), Battalion 5 (7 Fire Stations) and Battalion 9 (7 Fire Stations). OWB's headquarters is at Fire Station 82.[37]
Operations South Bureau compromises 3 battalions and 25 Fire Stations. Battalion 6 (11 Fire Stations), Battalion 13 (8 Fire Stations), Battalion 18 (6 Fire Stations). OSB's headquarters is at the San Pedro Municipal Building (638 South Beacon Street, Suite 374).[38]
Operations Valley Bureau compromises of 4 battalions and 31 Fire Stations. Battalion 10 (9 Fire Stations), Battalion 12 (7 Fire Stations), Battalion 14 (7 Fire Stations) and Battalion 15 (8 Fire Stations). OVB's headquarters is temporarily stationed at Fire Station 83.[39]
Each of the four operational Bureaus house a number of battalions. These battalions are staffed by uniformed personnel who rotate on a 24-hour platoon duty. Each battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief, who responds to major incidents within their battalion, usually 20-30 square miles in size. They have the responsibility of commanding these scenes as the Incident Commander (IC). Battalion Chiefs typically respond to these incidents with a Firefighter/Specialist, who holds the title of Emergency Incident Technician (EIT). EITs drive the Dodge RAM SUV to the scenes and act as an assistant to the Battalion Chief.
Note that stations with both a truck and a 200 series engine (pump) will usually respond the two apparatus together as a lightforce. So, for example, Truck 1 and Engine 201 will often respond together as Light Force 1.[21]  The only full time exception is Fire Station 9 where Engine 209 is fully staffed. Truck 9 responds as a single company when appropriate.  During "Augmented Staffing" (red-flag brush fire weather, or other increased threat days) the 200 series engines can be fully staffed as a 4-member Engine Company. Each company can then either be dispatched individually or as a "Task Force".
400 series Engines are ready reserve apparatus. These apparatus are full loaded with equipment and hose. They are used either for short term relief IE when a frontline apparatus is shut down for repair or maintenance. 400 series Engines are also staffed as needed during "High Hazard" days or other augmented staffing times.
The LAFD has six Type 3 wildland Engines. Five are property of the State of California OES but are staffed as needed and maintained by the LAFD.  Together these 5 Engines form Strike Team 1880C.[40] Engine 482C is housed at Fire Station 82 and is a ready reserve Type 3 wildland Engine.
