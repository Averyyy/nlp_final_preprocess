Critical reception[edit]
Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably calling it one of the best ballads of the year. She also says that McGraw's voice "oozes hurt and disillusionment."[1] Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A  grade, saying that the song begins "with the sound of hushed acoustic strumming, the arrangement picks up force as the song progresses, but the focus of attention remains the story of a marriage gradually unraveling. He goes on to say that the song "all comes through in McGraw s evocative performance, showcasing the layers of subtlety his voice had picked up in the years since his 'Indian Outlaw' days, while wife Faith Hill s plaintive background vocals add a further layer of pathos."[2]
Chart performance[edit]
"Angry All the Time" debuted at #48 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for the week of July 28, 2001.
