Early life
Selena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas,[1] to Ricardo Joel Gomez and Texas-born[2] former stage actress Mandy Teefey.[3] She was named after Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla, who died in 1995.[4][5] Her father is of Mexican descent, while her mother, who was adopted, has Italian ancestry.[6][7][8] Gomez's paternal grandparents emigrated to Texas from Monterrey in the 1970s.[9] Of her heritage, Gomez has said she is "a proud third-generation American-Mexican"[10] and "My family does have quincea eras, and we go to the communion church. We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church."[11] Gomez was fluent in Spanish until age seven.[9] Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother.[3][12] Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and her second husband, Brian Teefey,[13][14] and Victoria "Tori" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second wife, Sara.[15] She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.[16]
Gomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.[17] The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.[18] Gomez has said, "I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]."[19] She later added that her mother "was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me." Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they "raised her" until she found success in show business.[20]
Career
2002 2006: Career beginnings
Gomez first gained an interest in pursuing a career in entertainment watching her mother prepare for stage productions.[21] In 2002, she began her acting career on the children's television series Barney & Friends,[22][23] portraying the character Gianna.[24] The show was her first acting gig. Gomez recalled of the experience, "I was very shy when I was little [...] I didn't know what 'camera right' was. I didn't know what blocking was. I learned everything from Barney."[25] Gomez appeared in thirteen episodes of the show between 2002 and 2004; the show's producers released her as she was "too old" for the series.[25] While working on Barney & Friends, Gomez had bit part roles in the film Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) and the made-for-television film Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire (2005).[26][27] She guest starred in a 2006 episode of the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.[28][27]

Gomez was given a recurring role on the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana in 2007 as pop star Mikayla.[25] During this time, Gomez filmed pilot episodes for two potential Disney Channel series; the first was a Suite Life spin-off titled Arwin!,[29] and the second was a Lizzie McGuire spin-off titled What's Stevie Thinking?.[30][31] She later auditioned for a role in the network's series Wizards of Waverly Place, ultimately winning the lead role of Alex Russo.[25] Gomez and her mother subsequently moved to Los Angeles.[23] Wizards of Waverly Place saw Gomez playing a teenage girl in a family of wizards who own a restaurant in New York City.[32] The series quickly became a success for the Disney Channel and represented Gomez's breakthrough into the mainstream.[33] The role of Alex Russo brought Gomez "teen idol" status.[34] She became an icon for (adolescent) girls and women, yet details of her personal life put her under public scrutiny and the media. When she was 15, paparazzi began to appear on the set. Working for Disney turned Gomez s life into a perpetual promotion, with her image quickly distributed through TV, movies, music, merchandise, live appearances, and cross-promotion of all of the above.  That was my job in a way to be perfect,  she says.  You re considered a figure kids look up to, and they take that seriously there.  It became part of Gomez s job to maintain that aura even as, simultaneously, the tabloid media began treating her as an object of interest.[35][36] It received numerous awards and nominations,[37][38] and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program.[39] It garnered positive reviews,[40][41] with Gomez's being particularly praised for her comic timing and sarcastic delivery.[40][42][43]

The first, titled What Boys Want, would feature Gomez as a girl who could hear the thoughts of men.[58] She later announced a film adaptation of the novel Thirteen Reasons Why, in which she was to play a young girl who commits suicide; ultimately, neither film was made,[59] but Gomez would later executive produce a television adaptation of Thirteen Reasons Why.[60]

Austin for their "acting skills that carry the film".[69] The film won the series its second consecutive Emmy for Outstanding Children's Program at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[70] Gomez recorded three songs on the television series and film's soundtrack, including the single "Magic",[71][72] which reached number sixty-one in the U.S.[52]

Gomez addressed the controversy, saying that "We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, [the backlash is] gonna come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing.[251] Despite the controversy, the first season was a critical success.[252] However, the other three seasons received generally negative reviews.[253][254][255] 13 Reasons Why was the most tweeted about show of 2017, and the most-watched original streaming series of 2018.[256][257] In 2022, its second season ranks as the ninth most watched English-language television series on Netflix, with 496.1 million hours viewed within 28 days of release.[258][259] The series ended after four seasons in June 2020.[260] Gomez recorded a cover version of the song "Only You" for the series' first season soundtrack.[261]
