Laurel Hollow is a village in the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 1,952 at the 2010 census.[3] According to Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Laurel Hollow was the eighth wealthiest town in America.[4]
History[edit]
The settlement began circa 1653 with purchase of land from the local natives.[5] The village was incorporated in 1926 as "Lauralton," but the name was changed to "Laurel Hollow" in 1935 to avoid postal confusion with Laurelton in Queens.[5] Today, Laurel Hollow is served by post offices in the hamlets of Syosset, Oyster Bay, Woodbury and Cold Spring Harbor.
The globally renowned Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is located in the village.
