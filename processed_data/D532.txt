Weighing scale to determine paper weight
Paper density is a paper product's mass per unit volume.  The density can be calculated by dividing the grammage of paper (in grams per square metre or "gsm") by its caliper (usually in micrometres, occasionally in mils).[1]
The "ISO 534:2011, Paper and board   Determination of thickness, density and specific volume" indicates that the paper density is expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3).[2]
