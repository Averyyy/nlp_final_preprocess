Blue Mountain State is an American television sitcom that premiered on Spike (now Paramount Network) on January 11, 2010. The series was created by Chris Romano and Eric Falconer, and produced by Lionsgate Television. The series is about a fictional university, Blue Mountain State, and its football team, the "Mountain Goats". It portrays certain aspects of American university life, including college football, sex, binge drinking, drugs, wild partying, and hazing. Over the years, due in large part to being streamable on Netflix, the series has developed a cult following.
In February 2012, it was reported that Blue Mountain State would not be renewed for a fourth season.[1] On April 8, 2014, The BMS Movie was announced and a Kickstarter launched on April 15, 2014. The Kickstarter campaign reached its goal of $1.5 million on May 11, 2014, and the film was released in February 2016.

Reception[edit]
Metacritic gave the series 38 out of 100, from the four reviews it collected.[2] Brian Lowry of Variety found that "Blue Mountain embraces that (crude comedy) aspect of Spike's mandate over all else   putting the bodily function/semi-nudity cart before the sitcom horse."[3] Lowry also stated: "[Spike] has simply made this too-blue "Mountain" into a comedic molehill."[3] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald gave the series a favorable review saying, "Blue is also frequently funny in a raunchy American Pie way. It's a college comedy in which the guys want to get wasted and laid, in whatever order." Joe Walljasper of the Columbia Daily Tribune describes the series as appealing to those who viewed the film Porky's and "felt that the jokes were a little too high-brow.".[4]
In its first season, the show averaged 949,000 viewers in its first six episodes while improving on the time slot by 165% among men 18 24.[5] In its second season, its premiere drew a 1.34 rating in Men 18 34, up 34% compared to the first season average and was ranked No. 2 in its timeslot. Over the season it showed significant ratings growth compared to season 1, delivering a +33% increase in Men 18 34, +50% in Men 18 24, and +14% in Men 18 49.[6] Season 3 of Blue Mountain State started airing on September 21, 2011 on Spike.[7]
The show has gathered a cult following after it was released on Netflix.[8][9] Fans of the show often start petitions and Facebook pages to make Spike bring the show back for a fourth season. Many members of the cast, especially Page Kennedy, hinted at a reunion project in the month leading up the announcement of the film. Kennedy made Vines and tweeted with show stars Darin Brooks, Alan Ritchson, Frankie Shaw, Chris Romano and Sam Jones III.

Feature film[edit]
Main article: Blue Mountain State: The Rise of Thadland
In March 2013, Ed Marinaro stated in an interview with Class Act Sports that he was working on a Blue Mountain State film. He continued to hint on Twitter at some 'behind-the-scenes' work being done on said movie.[13] In early March 2014, Page Kennedy started hinting at Blue Mountain State reunion project on Instagram, Vine and Twitter along with Darin Brooks, Kelly Kruger, Alan Ritchson, Sam Jones III, Frankie Shaw and Romanski. 
On April 8, 2014, Blue Mountain State: The Movie was officially announced. To help make the announcement, Alan Ritchson, in character as Thad Castle, made a fake video featuring Jimmy Kimmel (the Kimmel footage was from a 2013 interview with Kanye West). 
On April 15, the production launched a Kickstarter campaign, much like the hugely successful 2013 campaign by Veronica Mars to get the cancelled show made into a feature film. The project's goal was to raise $1.5 million by May 15 in order to fund the film. There were rewards for donating to campaign, such as personalized tweets from the cast (for donating $10), shot and pint glasses with the BMS logo ($20), and a speaking role in the film (for a $10,000 donation). 
On May 11, 2014, the Kickstarter goal of $1.5 million was reached. On May 15, 2014 the Kickstarter campaign ended, with the final funds raised being $1,911,827 from 23,999 backers.[14]
In May 2014, it was announced Jay Chandrasekhar would be the director of the film.[15] However, on September 28, 2014, Lev L. Spiro was announced as the new director of BMS: The Movie.[15] The crew started filming in late 2014 on location in Wilmington, North Carolina.[16][17] Filming was reportedly complete by December 14, 2014.
The film, titled Blue Mountain State: The Rise of Thadland, was officially released on February 2, 2016.[18]
