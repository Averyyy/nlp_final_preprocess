Puce is a dark red or purple brown color,[1] a brownish purple[2] or a "dark reddish brown."[3]
Etymology[edit]
The colour is said to be the color of bloodstains on linen or bedsheets, even after being laundered, from flea droppings, or after a flea has been crushed.
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) dates the first English use of "puce" as a color to 1778.[4] The name comes from the French word puce, or flea, which comes from the Latin word for flea, pulex (stem pulic-). According to the Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, the first French use of puce as a color name, meaning flea-color, dates to the 17th century.[5] A different source dates the first French use of puce as a color name to the 14th century.[6]
History[edit]
The color puce became popular in the late 18th century in France. It appeared in clothing at the Court of Louis XVI, and was said to be a favorite color of Marie Antoinette, though there are no portraits of her wearing it.[7][8][9]
Puce was also a popular fashion color in 19th-century Paris. In one of his novels,  mile Zola described a woman "dressed in a gown of a dark color...between puce and the color of goose poop (caca d'oie)."[10] Victor Hugo wrote in Les Mis rables, "[...] Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since."[11]

In Santa Claus: The Movie (1985), Jeffrey Kramer's character, Towser, picks the color puce for the color of Patch the Elf's (Dudley Moore) lollipop.  He describes the color as "like fuchsia, but a shade less lavender and a bit more pink." He also mentions to his boss, B.Z.
