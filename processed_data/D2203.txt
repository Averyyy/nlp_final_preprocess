The Miss Florida USA competition is the pageant that selects the representative for the state of Florida in the Miss USA pageant.
Up until the 2017 pageant, both Miss and Teen state pageants were held separately in different months. In recent years, the organization was decided that both pageants would compete at the same time from 2018 onwards, just like the most of state pageants in the Miss USA system.
While Florida has had number of runners-up, finalists, and semi-finalists, the state has yet to win the Miss USA title. Although Cheryl Patton, who placed 2nd runner-up in Miss USA 1967, became Miss USA after Sylvia Hitchcock won Miss Universe. The most recent placement was Ashley Cari o placed 2nd runner-up in 2021.
Two former Miss Florida Teen USA titleholders have won this competition, and three titleholders have also competed at Miss America.
In 2019, contestant Madison Anderson (who finished first runner-up in that pageant) would go on to become Miss Universe Puerto Rico 2019, and then competed in Miss Universe 2019, placed first runner-up to Zozibini Tunzi of South Africa.[1]  On 11 August 2022, contestant Ashley Cari o (who finished second runner-up at Miss USA 2021) was crowned Miss Universe Puerto Rico 2022 and represented Puerto Rico at Miss Universe 2022, ultimately placing in the Top 5
The current titleholder is Taylor Fulford of Okeechobee and was crowned on May 29, 2022. She represented Florida for the title of Miss USA 2022.

Davila was dethroned on July 22, 2016, after it was revealed that she allegedly hired outside hair and makeup professionals during the Miss Florida USA state pageant instead of the ones provided by the organization, which is explicitly against pageant rules. The pageant stated it gave D vila an unfair advantage. She was later found to be innocent of the accusation.[3]
