Awards and honours[edit]
Ruby Gloom was nominated for a Gemini Award in the category of "Best Animated Program or Series."[5]
The script for episode "Yam Ween", written by Carolyn Bennett, was a finalist in the 2007 Canadian Screenwriting Awards.[6]
Reception[edit]
Ruby Gloom received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences, praising it for its characters, writing, soundtrack, and plot. It would go on to garner a cult following.[citation needed]
Common Sense Media gave the series a rating of four stars out of five, saying: "A nice mix of sweet-and-sour, Ruby Gloom's dark gothic setting underscores all the cooperation and kindness. Adults will enjoy jokes that kids may miss, such as when it's revealed that Ruby eats Glum Flakes cereal for breakfast. And all but the most sensitive kids will be too enraptured by fantastic elements like talking pictures and a school for ghosts to be unnerved by dark elements like Misery's constant talk of disasters and death".
Telecast and home media[edit]
Ruby Gloom premiered on YTV in Canada on October 13, 2006, alongside the final episode's airing on June 1, 2008, with repeats until the early 2010s. Repeats are now airing on Nickelodeon Canada. In the United Kingdom, the series aired on Pop and Pop Girl in 2008. Irish network RT  Two aired the series in 2010. It also aired on 2x2 in Russia, Super RTL in Germany, Rai Gulp in Italy, RTP2 in Portugal, Pakapaka in Argentina and ABC1 and ABC3 in Australia in 2008. In Arab World, it aired on MBC 3 and Al-Majid Tv Network , and it also aired on Cartoon Network Japan in 2009.
