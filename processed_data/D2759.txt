Psych is an American detective comedy-drama television series created by Steve Franks for USA Network.[1] The series stars James Roday Rodriguez as Shawn Spencer, a young crime consultant for the Santa Barbara Police Department whose "heightened observational skills"[2] and impressive eidetic memory allow him to convince people that he solves cases with psychic abilities. The program also stars Dul  Hill as Shawn's intelligent best friend and reluctant partner Burton "Gus" Guster, as well as Corbin Bernsen as Shawn's father, Henry, a former detective with the Santa Barbara Police Department.[3]
Psych premiered on July 7, 2006, following the fifth-season premiere of Monk, and continued to be paired with the series until Monk's conclusion on December 4, 2009. During the second season, an animated segment titled "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" was added to the series. Psych was the highest-rated US basic cable television premiere of 2006.[4] USA Network renewed the series for an eighth season on December 19, 2012, to include eight episodes, and ordered two more episodes on June 25, 2013, bringing the episode order to ten.[5][6] On February 5, 2014, USA Network confirmed that the eighth season of Psych would be its last, with the series finale airing on March 26, 2014.[7]
Psych: The Movie, a two-hour TV film, aired on USA Network on December 7, 2017.[8] Franks' hope is to make five more Psych movies, following Psych: The Movie.[9] On February 14, 2019, it was announced Psych: The Movie 2 was greenlit and all the main cast would return for the TV film, which was set to premiere in late 2019, but the premiere thereof was subsequently delayed to 2020, with the film renamed Psych 2: Lassie Come Home. The film was released on NBCUniversal's streaming service, Peacock, July 15, 2020, the day the service officially launched.[10][11][12] On May 13, 2021, Peacock announced a third film, Psych 3: This Is Gus, which premiered on November 18, 2021.[13][14]
Overview[edit]
Most episodes begin with a cold open in the form of a flashback to Shawn and Gus's childhoods. The flashbacks usually involve Shawn and Gus being taught a lesson by a young Henry Spencer (Shawn's father) (Corbin Bernsen), who wishes that his son would follow in his footsteps and become a law enforcement officer. These lessons often play a role for the climax of the episode. As a child, Shawn was taught by Henry to hone his powers of observation and deduction, often using games and challenges to test him. Each flashback also sets the theme for the episode.
Shawn originally becomes known as a psychic when, after calling in tips on dozens of crimes covered on the news which help the police to close the case, the police become suspicious of his knowledge, theorizing that such knowledge could only come from the "inside" and unwilling to believe that it is merely Shawn having honed his observational skills. To avoid being sent to jail, Shawn uses those skills to convince the police that he is psychic; though the interim police chief warns Shawn that if his "powers" are fake, he will be prosecuted. With no choice but to keep up the act, and having proven himself an effective aid to the police in solving crimes, he establishes a psychic detective agency, Psych, and becomes an outside consultant to the police. Pretending to have psychic powers allows him to engage in strange and comic behavior as he turns real clues into hunches and otherworldly visitations. He enjoys teasing lifelong friend Burton Guster (Gus), a pharmaceutical sales representative, about Gus's eclectic interests as they drive around in a blue Toyota Echo nicknamed "The Blueberry"[15] solving crimes.
Head detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), playfully nicknamed "Lassie" by Shawn and Gus, quietly comes to respect Shawn's crime-solving skills despite doubting his psychic abilities; Lassiter is constantly exasperated by Shawn keeping investigations ongoing and/or infuriated by Shawn's antics. However, junior detective Juliet "Jules" O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Chief Vick (Kirsten Nelson) are far less antagonistic  with O'Hara expressing belief in Shawn's abilities while Vick is mum on the subject  and usually willing to give Shawn the leeway he needs to solve cases. Henry and Shawn have a difficult relationship, but despite this, Henry reluctantly helps Shawn on various occasions.

Production[edit]
The show uses White Rock, British Columbia, Canada for its Santa Barbara, California setting.[16] Psych also incorporates Vancouver and various locations around the Lower Mainland of British Columbia as a backdrop. Santa Barbara is on a mountainous coastline without bays and just has the few Channel Islands miles offshore. Many of the overlooking helicopter shots and set-up shots (in which the exterior of the Santa Barbara Courthouse is shown) are actually filmed in Santa Barbara. The animated segments "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" were created by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. The music, effects, and sound design for "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" were created by Fred Weinberg.
Casting[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (December 2021)
Anne Dudek's character was written out of the series after the character generated a negative test audience reaction with Lassiter due to their relationship. Maggie Lawson was cast as Juliet O'Hara to serve as a replacement.[17][18]
Theme song[edit]
The theme song for Psych is "I Know You Know" by The Friendly Indians, series creator Steve Franks's band. Some episodes in seasons three through eight use an extended version of "I Know You Know" consisting of the first verse and the chorus,[19] but most episodes use a shortened version consisting of mostly the chorus. In some episodes, the theme song is changed, usually as a tie-in to the theme of the episode to come.
Variations[edit]
The theme was given a Christmas theme for the episode "Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy". It was used again in "Christmas Joy" (3.09) and "The Polarizing Express".
The song was sung in Spanish for "Lights, Camera... Homicidio" and "No Country for Two Old Men".
It was expanded into a Bollywood-themed version sung in Hindi in "Bollywood Homicide" while each of the theme credits was shown first in Hindi, then in English.
Boyz II Men performed an a cappella version of the theme for "High Top Fade Out". It was used again for the episode "Let's Doo-Wop It Again".
In  "Romeo and Juliet and Juliet", the main titles are translated in Chinese. However, the actual theme song is not edited.
Curt Smith of Tears for Fears guest-starred in "Shawn 2.0"  and recorded his own version of the theme. Smith also recorded a song ("This is Christmas") for the episode "The Polarizing Express".[20]
Julee Cruise, who recorded the theme for Twin Peaks, recorded a slower, extended version of the theme for the Twin Peaks-inspired episode "Dual Spires".
A superhero-themed version was recorded for "The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man, Issue #2". The main titles were also redone in a comic-book style.
For the episode "Heeeeere's Lassie", the song and main titles were given a theme similar to The Shining.
The Christmas-themed and Hindi versions of the song also include variations on the main titles. The Hindi and Chinese-themed episodes phonetically translated words into Devanagari and Chinese characters, respectively, in their title sequences. The title sequence in the episode "Dual Spires" is an almost shot-for-shot recreation of the title sequence of Twin Peaks. The episode "100 Clues" featured an entirely new main title sequence based on the board game Clue. The actor names and title were shown on game cards similar to those of the cards of suspects in Clue.
Pineapple[edit]
In the "pilot", Roday improvised by picking up a pineapple and saying, "Should I slice this up for the road?" Since then, pineapples have appeared in every episode as a running gag, whether just one in the background or the actual mention of it. It is Shawn's go-to housewarming gift. The pineapple is a major marketing point for items related to the show on the USA website.[21] Fan movements, such as fan-made websites, have also been dedicated to finding a pineapple or pineapple-related object in each episode.[22]
"Psych: The Musical"[edit]
Main article: Psych: The Musical
Before season 8 was aired, the show did a special, 88-minute musical episode.
Series finale aftershow[edit]
Following the series finale on March 26, 2014, USA Network aired a live aftershow entitled "Psych After Pshow." The hour-long special was hosted by Kevin Pereira and featured series stars and creator/executive producer Steve Franks.[23]
Release[edit]
Syndication[edit]
In July 2011, Ion Television announced that Psych would become part of its 2012 broadcast in syndication.[24] During 2012, reruns of the show mostly ran on Saturdays as a marathon. In 2013, Ion Television announced the acquisition option pick-up of season seven of Psych. It no longer airs on Ion Television. The deal with NBC Universal Cable & New Media Distribution adds all 16 new episodes of season seven to Ion's existing library of seasons one six of Psych and includes rights to future seasons.[25] As of January 2023, Psych started airing on Hallmark Movies and Mysteries.

Psych: The Movie[edit]
Main article: Psych: The Movie
On May 8, 2017, USA Network announced Psych: The Movie, a two-hour TV film to air December 7, 2017.[51] All the original main cast would return for the TV film, which was directed by series creator Steve Franks and written by Franks and series star, James Roday Rodriguez. Zachary Levi was later announced for the film as the main villain, "Thin White Duke",[52] while Jazmyn Simon   Dul  Hill's real-life fianc e   played Selene, a romantic interest for Gus.[53] On July 5, 2017, Charlotte Flair announced that she would be in Psych: The Movie as Heather Rockrear.[54]
On June 28, 2017, former guest star Ralph Macchio joined the cast reprising his role as Nick Conforth,[55] the police academy officer who trained Shawn and Gus in season 5. Principal photography took place from May 25 to June 18[56][57] in Vancouver, British Columbia. It was later announced that Timothy Omundson would have a reduced role due to a stroke, but would still appear.[58] In addition, Kurt Fuller, John Cena and Jimmi Simpson were confirmed to be reprising their respective roles of Woody Strode, Ewan O'Hara and Mary Lightly.

Main article: Psych 2: Lassie Come Home
On February 14, 2019, it was announced Psych: The Movie 2 was greenlit and all the main cast would return for the TV film, set to premiere in 2019.[10] On April 18, 2019, it was announced Joel McHale would be joining the TV film, as well as Jimmi Simpson, reprising his recurring role as Mary Lightly.[59] On September 17, 2019, it was announced that the sequel had been renamed Psych 2: Lassie Come Home and would instead be airing on NBCUniversal's new streaming service, Peacock. Consequently, the film will only debut after the streaming service is launched.[60][11] In a November 2019 interview with Larry King, Timothy Omundson revealed that the film would revolve around the characters rallying together in support of Lassie's recovery following a stroke, mirroring Omundson's real-life stroke which led to his reduced presence in Psych: The Movie.[61]
