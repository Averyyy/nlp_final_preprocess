James Joseph "Duffy" Waldorf, Jr. (born August 20, 1962) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour Champions. He was previously a member of the PGA Tour, where he won four times.
Biography[edit]
Waldorf was born in Los Angeles, California. He attended UCLA[2] where he was on the golf team from 1982 to 1985. He was a two-time NCAA All-American, 1985 College Player of the Year, and was selected for the 1985 Walker Cup.
Waldorf turned professional in 1985 and joined the PGA Tour.
Waldorf's career PGA Tour earnings are over $11.9 million. He has featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings, peaking at 35th in 2000.
Waldorf finished T-14 in the 2007 Q-School to regain his 2008 PGA Tour card.  However, after playing in only 4 events, he underwent knee surgery in May 2008.[3] A recurring knee problem hindered Waldorf, who sat out the entire 2009 and 2010 seasons. He played in 14 events during the 2011 season. He failed to satisfy his Medical Extension and split the 2012 season among the PGA Tour, Nationwide Tour, and Champions Tour.
