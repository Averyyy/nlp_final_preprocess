St. Elizabeth is a village in Miller County, Missouri, United States. The population was 336 at the 2010 census.
History[edit]
St. Elizabeth was originally called Charlestown, and under the latter name was platted in 1875, and named after Charley Holtschneider, the original owner of the town site.[4] A post office called St. Elizabeth has been in operation since 1877.[5] The present name is derived from a local Roman Catholic church of the same name, which in turn most likely was named after Elizabeth of Hungary.[4]
The Boeckman Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[6]
