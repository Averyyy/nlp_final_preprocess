White chocolate is a confectionery typically made of sugar, milk, and cocoa butter, but no cocoa solids. It is pale ivory in color, and lacks many of the compounds found in other chocolates such as milk and dark.[1] It is solid at room temperature (25 C (77 F)) because the melting point of cocoa butter, the only white cocoa bean component, is 35 C (95 F).[2]
As for the other two main types of chocolate (dark and milk), white chocolate is used for chocolate bars or as a coating in confectionery.
History[edit]
As white chocolate is essentially milk chocolate devoid of cocoa solids, it is perhaps noteworthy to recall that the latter was developed in the late 19th century by Daniel Peter and that it quickly became the most popular type of chocolate.[3]
 1936 ad for Milkybar
In 1936, the white chocolate tablet Milkybar (or Galak) was launched in Europe by the Swiss company Nestl ,[4] a major player in the Swiss chocolate industry and owner of the Peter-Cailler-Kohler factory.[5] Nestl  is generally credited for the first white chocolate bar, although earlier forms of white chocolate had probably been made before 1936.[6] Making white chocolate was a way to use milk powder and cocoa butter, which were then produced in excess.[7]
From about 1948 until the 1990s, Nestl  also produced a white chocolate bar with almond pieces, Alpine White, for markets in the United States and Canada.[4] Other chocolate manufacturers developed their own formulas, such as that developed by Kuno Baedeker for the Merckens Chocolate Company in 1945.[8] As white chocolate became mainstream, white versions of popular chocolate bars appeared, for instance Toblerone in 1973[9] and Hershey's Kisses in 1993.[6]
As of 2022, white chocolate accounts for about 10 percent of the overall chocolate market.[10]

White chocolate does not contain cocoa solids, the primary non-fat constituent of conventional chocolate liquor   chocolate in its raw, unsweetened form. These are, however, replaced by milk solids. During manufacturing, the dark-colored solids of the cocoa bean are separated from its fatty content, as with milk chocolate and dark chocolate, but, unlike with other forms of chocolate, no cocoa mass is added back; cocoa butter is the only cocoa ingredient in white chocolate. White chocolate contains only trace amounts of the stimulants theobromine and caffeine which are present in the cocoa mass but not the butter.[11] Flavorings such as vanilla may be added to white chocolate confectionery.[12] Caramelized white chocolate is called "blonde chocolate" and has a different flavor profile.[13]
White chocolate is the type of chocolate containing the highest percentage of milk solids, typically around or over 30 percent, while milk chocolate has only around 25 percent.[14]
Regulations[edit]
Regulations govern what may be marketed as white chocolate: Since 2000 in the European Union, white chocolate must be (by weight) at least 20% cocoa butter, 14% total milk solids, and 3.5% milk fat.[15] As of May 2021, the European Food Safety Authority proposed banning the food coloring agent, E171 (titanium dioxide), used as a common whitener in some white chocolate products.[16]
Since 2004 in the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations defined that white chocolate should contain "not less than 20 percent by weight of cacao fat", "not less than 3.5 percent by weight of milkfat and not less than 14 percent by weight of total milk solids", and "not more than 55 percent by weight of a nutritive carbohydrate sweetener."[17] Acceptable dairy elements when manufacturing white chocolate in the United States include evaporated milk, skim milk, buttermilk, or malted milk. White chocolate products may not contain artificial coloring agents.[17]

The history of white chocolate is largely unclear, but "the general consensus," says Eagranie Yuh, author of "The Chocolate Tasting Kit" (Chronicle, 2014), "is that Nestl  was the first to develop white chocolate commercially in 1936 in Switzerland. The story is that it was a way to use up excess milk powder that had been produced for World War I and was no longer in demand." [...] White chocolate is also a way to use up extra cocoa butter that is extracted from the cocoa bean when making cocoa powder.
