Brand of men's hair dye
Grecian Formula is a men's hair coloring product from Combe Incorporated. Until recently,[when?] the formulation used in the United States contained lead(II) acetate.[1] Because lead acetate was banned in cosmetics in Canada and the European Union, the formulations sold there did not contain it.[1][2] In 2017 the Environmental Defense Fund and other consumer groups filed a complaint with the Food and Drug Administration to force the removal of lead acetate from Grecian Formula and other hair dyes.[3] As of July 2018, ingredients of Grecian Formula are water, isopropyl alcohol, triethanolamine, bismuth citrate, sodium thiosulfate, fragrance, and panthenol. Lead acetate has been replaced by bismuth citrate as the progressive colorant.
