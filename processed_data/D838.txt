Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 is a sports video game developed by EA Tiburon and published by EA Sports for PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360.
Features[edit]
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 features the Ryder Cup tournament for the first time in the game franchise's history. The game also features for the first time a 24 player online multiplayer mode allowing game players to compete in the Ryder Cup online, representing either the American or European side of the tournament.[1]
The Wii version introduces two new swing modes, one being Advance Plus, a mode in which the direction of the swing is tracked, and the other being Tour Pro, in which the camera changes to first person and the club is 1:1 controlled (the club is seen as if looking downwards at it). For this mode, it is suggested that the player places a real golf ball on the ground in order to see a point of reference while playing. The version also adds 36 miniature golf holes and an online disc golf mode.
Also featured is the "True View" feature, a step toward adding some realism to the game by removing some assists, namely the fly-by view prior to taking a swing, forcing the player to use camera positions near the in-game golfer and the map for the green.
