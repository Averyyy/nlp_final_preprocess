Daniel Radcliffe, who portrayed the series' title character, Harry Potter, was the icon of the film series from the release of the first film in 2001.
This is a list of Harry Potter cast members who portrayed or voiced characters appearing in the film series. The list below is sorted by film and the character's surname, as some characters have been portrayed by multiple actors.
Overview
Dozens of actors from the United Kingdom and Ireland portrayed or voiced characters appearing in the Harry Potter film series based on the book series by J. K. Rowling. In all the films, Daniel Radcliffe played Harry Potter, Rupert Grint played Ron Weasley and Emma Watson played Hermione Granger. When they were cast only Radcliffe had previously acted in a film.[1] Complementing them on screen are such actors as Helena Bonham Carter, Jim Broadbent, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, John Hurt, Jason Isaacs, Miriam Margolyes, Helen McCrory, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and Julie Walters, among others. Thirteen actors appeared as the same character in all eight films of the series.[2]
Some well-known British actors who have not appeared in the series were asked in jest why they had not been cast. When David Yates was directing the fifth film, Bill Nighy (who knew Yates personally) said that he hoped the director would cast him in Harry Potter. "But nobody called", Nighy added.[3] However, in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in the seventh film. Nighy said, "I am no longer the only English actor not to be in Harry Potter and I am very pleased."[4] Jude Law once quipped, "Nobody's asked me. I was a bit too old for Harry."[5] He would later be cast as a younger Albus Dumbledore in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.[6]
J. K. Rowling gave a speech at the premiere of the final film in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows   Part 2, on 7 July 2011 in London. Rowling praised the film series' acting talent and announced that there are seven young Harry Potter cast members whom she refers to as "The Big Seven"; they are Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, Evanna Lynch and Bonnie Wright.[7]

Notes
^ Vincent Crabbe is a recurring minor character who appears in every book, and dies in a pivotal scene in Deathly Hallows.[12] During production of the seventh film, Waylett pleaded guilty to charges of growing marijuana,[13] and Joshua Herdman, who plays Crabbe's cohort Gregory Goyle, said in August 2009 that Waylett would not be reprising his role. Herdman's character instead died in the final film.[14]
^ Gambon replaced Harris as Dumbledore from Prisoner of Azkaban onwards after Harris's death.[17]
^ Davis played Filius Flitwick in the first two films as a white-haired old man. In pre-production for the third film, the producers told Davis there was no role for Flitwick, but that they would like to have him play somebody else at least in a cameo. Davis played a much younger-looking man with dark hair and moustache who is seen directing a choir at the Hogwarts welcome feast, and was credited as "Wizard". During pre-production of Goblet of Fire, director Mike Newell told Davis he wanted to keep the character's look from the previous film permanent.[33]
^ A scene with Mr Borgin was shot for Chamber of Secrets but was cut from the theatrical version.[80]
^ Knox was stabbed to death on 24 May 2008 before Half-Blood Prince was released.[146] The cast and crew of Half-Blood Prince wore white ribbons to the London premiere of the film in tribute to Knox.[147]
