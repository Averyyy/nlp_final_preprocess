Nel Ust Wyclef Jean[2] (/ wa kl f  /; born October 17, 1969)[2][3] is a Haitian rapper, musician, and actor.[4] At the age of nine,[5] Jean immigrated to the United States with his family. He first achieved fame as a founding member, co-producer and guitarist of the New Jersey hip hop trio The Fugees, alongside Lauryn Hill and Pras Michel. The group released the albums Blunted on Reality (1994) and The Score (1996), the latter becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. Jean would follow this with the release of his first solo studio album, Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival (1997), which contains the top ten hit "Gone till November".
In 1997, Jean was featured on Destiny Child's breakout single "No, No, No". Afterwards, he co-wrote the 1999 singles "My Love Is Your Love" (for Whitney Houston) and "Maria Maria" (for Santana). His second solo album The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book (2000), included the song "911" (featuring Mary J. Blige), and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His third album Masquerade (2002), peaked within the top ten on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2006, he was featured on the US Billboard Hot 100 number one single "Hips Don't Lie" by Shakira. His sixth studio album Carnival Vol. II: Memoirs of an Immigrant (2007), spawned the single "Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill)" (featuring Akon, Niia & Lil Wayne)". Jean performed his single "Dar um Jeito (We Will Find a Way)", at the closing ceremony for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.
In 2007, Jean was appointed Ambassador-at-Large of the Republic of Haiti by President Ren  Pr val.[6] In 2010, he filed for candidacy in the 2010 Haitian presidential election.[7] However, Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council ruled him ineligible to stand for office, as he had not met the constitutional requirement to have been a resident in Haiti for five years prior to the election.[3][8] Jean's highly publicized efforts to raise relief funds after the 2010 Haitian earthquake were channeled through his charitable organization, Y le Haiti. The charity, which conducted education and welfare activities in Haiti between 2005 and 2010, effectively closed in 2012. The New York Times reported that much of the money raised by the organization in the Hope for Haiti Now telethon was retained by Jean for his own benefit.[9]
He has won three Grammy Awards, and has received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his musical work.[10][11] Pitchfork dubbed him as arguably the "best rapper-guitarist of all-time".[12] In 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Jean with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Officer. Jean has also been inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.
Early life[edit]
Named after the biblical scholar John Wycliffe,[13] Wyclef Jean was born in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti[2] on October 17, 1969.[14] At nine years old, he emigrated with his family to Brooklyn, New York City, and ultimately settled in East Orange and Newark, New Jersey. Jean began to make music as a child, and as a teen, his mother, having recognized his musical talent, bought him a guitar. He has cited reggae artist Bigga Haitian as one of his early influences, as well as neighborhood heroes MC Tiger Paw Raw and producer Lobster v. Crab.[15] He has stated that he played music to earn respect.[16]
Jean graduated from Newark's Vailsburg High School and enrolled for one semester at Five Towns College in New York.[17] In 2009 he enrolled in the Berklee College of Music to pursue his diploma.[18] Jean has been a resident of Saddle River, South Orange, and North Caldwell, New Jersey.[19][20]
Music career[edit]
Fugees (1988 1997)[edit]
Jean and other musicians formed a group in the 1980s under the name Tranzlator Crew. Jean and band member Lauryn Hill pursued a romantic relationship beginning in 1992, and ending in 1997, the year of the band's breakup. Jean later revealed that Hill's dishonesty about the parentage of her child, Zion David, caused the rift that split the group up.[21] After they signed with Ruffhouse Records and Columbia Records in 1993, they renamed their group as Fugees   an abbreviation of "refugees", and also a sometimes derogatory reference to Haitian immigrants.[22] The group's debut album, Blunted on Reality, was released in 1994. It achieved limited commercial success, peaking at number 62 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album peaked at number 122 on the UK Albums Chart in 1997, and it was certified gold by the Syndicat National de l' dition Phonographique (SNEP).[23][24][25] Blunted on Reality spawned three singles: "Boof Baf", "Nappy Heads" and "Vocab". "Nappy Heads" was the Fugees' first single to be ranked on the US Billboard Hot 100, charting at number 49.[26]
In 1996, Fugees released their second album, titled The Score. The album achieved significant commercial success in the U.S., topping the Billboard 200. It was later certified as six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It performed well in several overseas nations, topping the Austrian, Canadian, French, German and Swiss albums charts, while also peaking at number two in Sweden and the United Kingdom.[24][27][28][29]
Four commercially successful singles were released from The Score; "Fu-Gee-La", the first single from the album, peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA and by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI).[26][30] The other three singles   "Killing Me Softly", "Ready or Not" and "No Woman, No Cry"   did not appear on the Billboard Hot 100 as they were not released for commercial sale, making them ineligible to appear on the chart,[31] although they all received sufficient airplay to appear on the Hot 100 Airplay and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay charts. "Killing Me Softly", a cover of the Roberta Flack song "Killing Me Softly with His Song", performed strongly in other territories, topping the singles charts in Australia, Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom, among several others.[32]
"Ready or Not" peaked at number one in the UK and at number three in Sweden. "No Woman, No Cry"   a cover of the Bob Marley & The Wailers song of the same name   topped the singles chart in New Zealand. Fugees collaborated with singer Bounty Killer on the single "Hip-Hopera" and recorded the single "Rumble in the Jungle" for the soundtrack to the film When We Were Kings in 1997: although they have not released any studio albums since The Score, a compilation album, Greatest Hits, was released in 2003, and spawned the single "Take It Easy".[33]
1997 2004[edit]
Start of solo career[edit]
Jean announced plans to begin a solo career with 1997's Wyclef Jean Presents the Carnival Featuring the Refugee All-Stars (generally called The Carnival). The album's guests included Fugees members Lauryn Hill and Pras, along with Jean's siblings' group Melky Sedeck;[34] the I Threes (back-up vocals for Bob Marley); The Neville Brothers and Celia Cruz. The album was a hit, as were two singles: "We Trying to Stay Alive" (adapted from the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive") and "Gone till November" (recorded with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra).
Released in 2000, Jean's second solo album The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book was recorded with guests including Youssou N'Dour; Earth, Wind & Fire; Kenny Rogers; The Rock; and Mary J. Blige. With Blige he released "911" as a single. He was nominated for Best Hip-Hop Act at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards.[35][36]
Following the 9/11 attacks, Jean participated in the benefit concert America: A Tribute to Heroes, contributing a cover of the Bob Marley song "Redemption Song". His third album, Masquerade, was released in 2002. His fourth album, The Preacher's Son, was released in November 2003 as the follow-up to his first solo album, The Carnival. In 2004, he released his fifth album, Sak Pas  Presents: Welcome to Ha ti (Creole 101) (released in the U.S. by Koch Records). Most of its songs are in his native language of Haitian Creole like "Fanm Krey l" with the French Caribbean Admiral T. Jean also figured on the album Mozaik Krey l of this one in the song "Secret Lover". He then covered Creedence Clearwater Revival's song "Fortunate Son" for the soundtrack of the film The Manchurian Candidate (2004) and wrote the song "Million Voices" for the film Hotel Rwanda (2004).[citation needed]
Songwriting and producing[edit]
Jean co-wrote "My Love Is Your Love" for Whitney Houston's album of the same name. He produced and wrote songs for the soundtrack to Jonathan Demme's 2003 documentary The Agronomist, about the Haitian activist and radio personality Jean Dominique. With Jerry 'Wonder' Duplessis, Jean also composed the score of the documentary Ghosts of Cit  Soleil,[37] He helped produce the film and appears briefly onscreen speaking by telephone in 2004 to a "chimere" gang-leader and aspiring rapper, Winston "2Pac" Jean.[38]
"Hips Don't Lie" and The Carnival Vol. II (2004 2009)[edit]

During a period between 2004 and 2006, fueled by a reunion performance in the documentary Dave Chappelle's Block Party (2005), it appeared that Fugees would record a new album. However, Pras claimed to Billboard magazine, "To put it nicely, it's dead." Pras said the root of this animosity was the third member of the group, Lauryn Hill, and was quoted in Billboard as saying; "Me and Clef, we on the same page, but Lauryn Hill is in her zone, and I'm fed up with that shit. Here she is, blessed with a gift, with the opportunity to rock and give and she's running on some bullshit? I'm a fan of Lauryn's but I can't respect that."[39]
In 2006, Jean was featured in Shakira's smash hit "Hips Don't Lie". The song went on to become the highest selling single of the 21st century, in addition to reaching number one in over 55 countries. Jean and Shakira went on to perform the song at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2007 Grammy Awards. He joined Shakira on various dates of her Oral Fixation Tour in the U.S. Also in 2007, Jean scored the Angelina Jolie documentary A Place in Time.[40]
In August 2007, Jean released a new song called "Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill)" featuring Lil Wayne, Niia and Akon, which references the song "C.R.E.A.M." by the Wu-Tang Clan. One month later he released an album that he recorded in Atlanta, Georgia, with the help of T.I., who also collaborated with Jean on the songs "You Know What it is" and "My Swag" on the latter's 2007 album, T.I. vs. T.I.P. In 2008, an upbeat single "Let Me Touch Your Button" featuring will.i.am was released in the UK in conjunction with Jean's involvement with UK MOTOROKRSTAR.[41] Jean released a song with Serj Tankian called "Riot".

"Hold On", the lead single from the project, features dancehall artist Mavado.[43] In May 2014, a Jean video, "April Showers", was banned from YouTube after Cathy Scott, author of The Killing of Tupac Shakur, lodged a copyright infringement complaint claiming an image in the video was similar to an autopsy photo released in her book. YouTube temporally banned the video.[45] TMZ, which broke the story, reported that Scott and the video's director, Hezues R', had settled the matter and agreed that Hezues R' would include a screen credit to the book at the end of the video.[46]

Y le Haiti[edit]
Main article: Y le Haiti
In 2001, Jean established Y le Haiti, a charitable organization known legally as the Wyclef Jean Foundation and incorporated in Illinois. Following 2004's Hurricane Jeanne, the organization provided scholarships to 3,600 children in Gona ves, Haiti. It continued to provide scholarships, school funding, meals and other charitable benefits to citizens of Haiti in the following years.
After the 2010 Haitian earthquake, Y le became prominent in raising funds for disaster relief. According to Jean, Y le raised over $1 million in 24 hours over Twitter.[67] Jean took part in an MTV donation drive and other publicized fundraising,[68] such as the Hope for Haiti Now telethon, which he organized with actor and producer George Clooney.[69] Y le donated funds to orphanages, street cleaning crews, hospitals and medical clinics and organized food service to provide hot meals to refugees and victims of the catastrophe.[70][71][72][73]
By February 2010, questions were reported about the history and management of Y le. The New York Times reported that the charity had failed to file tax returns for several years. The former executive director, Sanjay Rawal, questioned Y le's ability to handle large projects and criticized its lack of financial controls.[74]
By August 2012, chief executive Derek Q. Johnson was the last remaining officer of the charity. He resigned and announced that Y le was closed, saying in a statement, "As the foundation's sole remaining employee, my decision implies the closure of the organization as a whole." New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman investigated Y le and attempted to reach a settlement over allegations of mismanagement. Schneiderman said that the charity had made improper payments to Jean, members of his family, and personal acquaintances. In 2010, after the earthquake in Haiti, Y le spent more than $9 million - with half of it going to travel expenses by Jean and his entourage, consultants' fees, and real estate fees. The charity has been the subject of lawsuits in Haiti for unpaid debts.[73]
Politics[edit]
Jean has supported politicians in Haiti. In 2011 he told Women's Wear Daily that he was "a big fan of Sarah Palin", former vice-presidential candidate of the Republican Party.[75] It was reported erroneously that Jean would be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa.[76][77]

On August 5, 2010, Wyclef confirmed rumors that he was running for president of Haiti during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The journalist questioned the rapper's citizenship qualifications, asking about his passport. Exclaim! magazine reported at the time that Jean would retire as chairman of Y le Haiti.[78] On August 5, Jean formally filed papers as a candidate for the 2010 Haitian presidential election.[79][80] Wyclef intended to run as a candidate for the Viv Ansanm (Live Together) political party.[80]
On August 20, 2010, his bid for candidacy was rejected by Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council. He was turned down because he did not meet the constitutional residency requirement of having lived in Haiti for five years before the November 28 election.[8] Jean said, "I respectfully accept the committee's final decision, and I urge my supporters to do the same.[81]
