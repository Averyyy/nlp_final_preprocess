Brian Keith Kelly (born October 25, 1961) is an American college football. He is the head football coach at Louisiana State University (LSU), a position he has held since the 2022 season. Kelly served as the head football coach at Grand Valley State University from 1991 to 2003, Central Michigan University from 2004 to 2006, the University of Cincinnati from 2006 to 2009, and the University of Notre Dame from 2010 to 2021. He led the Grand Valley State Lakers to consecutive NCAA Division II Football Championships in 2002 and 2003. Kelly's 2012 Notre Dame team reached the 2013 BCS National Championship Game, while his 2018 and 2020 teams made appearances in the College Football Playoff.
Early years[edit]
Kelly was born in Everett, Massachusetts, and was raised in a Catholic Irish-American family in Chelsea, Massachusetts.[3] He attended St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts. His father was a Boston politician.[4] He was a four-year club football player at Assumption College as a linebacker.[5] After graduating from Assumption in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in political science he served as linebackers coach, defensive coordinator, and softball coach from 1983 to 1986.[6][7]
Coaching career[edit]
Grand Valley State[edit]
Kelly joined the Grand Valley State University staff in 1987 as a graduate assistant and defensive backs coach for Tom Beck and became the defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator in 1989.[8][9][10] Kelly took over as head coach in 1991.[9] In his final three seasons the Lakers went 41 2, at one point winning 32 consecutive games.[11] The Lakers went 14 0 in 2002 en route to their first national title and went 14 1 in 2003 when they claimed their second National Championship.[12][13] Kelly was named the AFCA Division II Coach of the Year after each of these championship years.[14]
In his 13 years as head coach at Grand Valley State, the Lakers won five conference titles and made six Division II Playoff appearances.[15]
The 2001 team set 77 NCAA, GLIAC, and school records, including the all-time Division II scoring record, averaging 58.4 points per game.[16]
Kelly's record in 13 years at Grand Valley State was 118 35 2.[17]
Central Michigan[edit]
Kelly became the 24th head coach at Central Michigan University after the departure of Mike DeBord following the 2003 season.[18]
2004 season[edit]
Kelly inherited a team with limited success. Central Michigan had won more than three games only once in the previous four seasons.[19] CMU finished with a 4 7 record in 2004.[20]
2005 season[edit]
In Kelly's second year at Central Michigan, he coached the team to a 6 5 record the first winning season in seven years for the Chippewas.[21]
2006 season[edit]
In his third season, the Chippewas posted a 9 4 record under Kelly en route to winning the MAC Championship over Ohio and qualifying for the Motor City Bowl.[22][23] At the end of the 2006 season, Kelly left to accept the Cincinnati coaching vacancy three days after CMU won the 2006 MAC Championship. Jeff Quinn was named the interim for Central Michigan's contest in the Motor City Bowl against Middle Tennessee. Kelly's record at Central Michigan in three seasons was 19 16.
Cincinnati[edit]
Kelly was named Cincinnati's head coach on December 3, 2006, following the departure of Mark Dantonio.[24]
2006 season[edit]
In an unusual move, Cincinnati elected not to appoint an interim coach and asked Kelly to assume his duties immediately by coaching the Bearcats in their bowl game.Central Michigan was also preparing for a bowl appearance, so while Kelly was in Cincinnati preparing the Bearcats, much of his staff remained at Central Michigan to coach the Chippewas. Following Central Michigan's 31 14 win in the Motor City Bowl on December 26, most of his staff joined him in Cincinnati, where they went on to coach Cincinnati to a 27 24 victory over Western Michigan University in that year's International Bowl on January 6.[25][26]  Cincinnati's victory gave Kelly the unique distinction of having defeated the same team twice in a season as coach of two different teams (Central Michigan had defeated Western Michigan 31 7 earlier that season).[27]
2007 season[edit]
In his first full season, Kelly led Cincinnati to a competitive position in the Big East; the Bearcats' second ever 10-win season (its first since 1949); and a top-25 ranking.[28][29][30] On December 5, 2007, Kelly was named Big East Coach of the Year after leading the Bearcats to a 9 3 record.[31] Coach Kelly later led the Bearcats to a 31 21 victory in the PapaJohns.com Bowl over Southern Miss.[32]
2008 season[edit]
In 2008, Kelly led Cincinnati to its first ever outright Big East title with key wins over #20 West Virginia and #20 Pittsburgh.[33][34] The Bearcats had never defeated either team in Big East conference play. Kelly also became the first coach to win all three of the Bearcats' traveling trophies [citation needed] the Victory Bell (Miami [OH]), the Keg of Nails (Louisville), and the River City Rivalry Trophy (Pitt). The Bearcats played in the Orange Bowl versus the ACC champion, #21 Virginia Tech on January 1, 2009, but lost 20 7.[35] He won Big East Coach of the Year for the 2008 season.[36]
2009 season[edit]
After beginning the 2009 season unranked in all polls, Kelly's Bearcats reeled off 12 straight victories and finished the regular season undefeated.[37] Going into the bowl season, they were ranked #3 in the BCS Standings[38] and faced the Florida Gators in the Sugar Bowl. Kelly did not coach the team in the 51 24 loss to the Florida Gators because of his departure to Notre Dame.[39]
Among the honors that Cincinnati football achieved in 2009 was the highest academic rating among teams in the top 10 of the current BCS standings, according to the 2009 Graduation Success Rates, released Wednesday, November 18, by the NCAA.[citation needed] Cincinnati, which was fifth in the BCS standings, checked in with a 75 percent NCAA graduation rate and a 71 percent federal government rate, the only team in the BCS top 10 to surpass the 70 percent plateau in both.[citation needed] He won Big East Coach of the Year for the third time.[40] In addition, he won the Home Depot Coach of the Year.[41]
Kelly finished his tenure at Cincinnati with a 34 6 record. He finished second in school history in wins.[42]
Notre Dame[edit]
 Pepsi display setup in August 2010 at the Martin's Supermarket in Mishawaka, Indiana in anticipation of Kelly's first home game with Notre Dame.
In December 2009, Kelly agreed to replace Charlie Weis as Notre Dame's head coach[43]. On December 10, Kelly announced that he had taken the position at Notre Dame.[44] He made the decision not to coach the Bearcats in the Sugar Bowl on January 1, 2010, which the Bearcats lost in a blowout to the University of Florida Gators.[45][46]
2010 season[edit]
In 2010, Kelly beat Purdue 23 12 in his first game at Notre Dame but lost to Michigan 28 24 the following week.[47][48] In the following game, they lost on a fake field goal in overtime against Michigan State 34 31.[49] His team lost again at home against #16 Stanford before beating Boston College to put the Irish at 2 3.[50][51] On October 9, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to a 23 17 win over Pitt, snapping Notre Dame's 2-game losing streak to the Panthers taking the Irish to a 3 3 record on the season.[52]
In late October, Declan Sullivan, a student videographer, was killed during practice when the hydraulic lift he was using collapsed due to high winds. Kelly acknowledged it was his decision to hold practice outdoors that day.[53] The University was fined $77,500 by the Indiana Occupational Health and Safety Administration for safety violations related to the incident.[54]
Kelly led Notre Dame to a 44 20 win over Western Michigan to extend the Irish's winning streak to three games.[55] The next week they faced Navy, losing 35 17 to drop to 4 4 overall.[56]
 Kelly during his 2010 victory over the USC Trojans
When the Irish faced Tulsa, they were upset 28 27.[57] They sent out second string quarterback Tommy Rees who threw an interception with 30 seconds left in the game as the Irish had driven to the Tulsa 28-yard line and a potential game-winning field goal attempt.[58] Two weeks later Notre Dame played against No. 15 Utah, who was heavily favored. Utah was leading 3 0 early, but a special teams touchdown after a deflected punt and three Rees touchdown passes lifted the Notre Dame lead to 28 3. The victory over Utah gave Kelly a 5 5 record.[59] Notre Dame followed that win up with a 27 3 victory over Army to make Kelly and the Fighting Irish bowl eligible.[60] In the final game of the season, Notre Dame snapped an 8-game losing streak against its rival USC, winning 20 16 due to a strong defensive display, despite four turnovers by the Fighting Irish's offense.[61] Kelly's first Fighting Irish team was invited to play in the Sun Bowl, where they beat Miami 33 17.[62]
2011 season[edit]
In 2011, Notre Dame returned numerous starters from the previous year and was thought to be in contention for a BCS bowl bid.[63] However, in the opening game against South Florida, Notre Dame outgained its opponent 508 254 in yardage but lost 23 20 due to five turnovers (most within scoring range)[64]. The next week the Irish built a 24 7 lead against its rival Michigan but lost yet again 35 31 due to five turnovers.[65]
The following week the Irish defeated #15 Michigan State 31 13; the one-sided victory over the Spartans was the first of four wins in a row until the USC Trojans came to South Bend.[66][67] The Fighting Irish were behind early in the game but were driving toward an apparent tie when a fumbled snap on the Trojan three-yard line was returned by USC for a touchdown. Notre Dame never recovered, turning the ball over three times in the loss.[68]
Notre Dame then went on its second four-game win streak until losing to #4 Stanford 28 14 in the regular season finale.[67][69] At 8 4, the Irish secured a bid to the Champs Sports Bowl, where they played Florida State.[70] Against Florida State, Notre Dame again built a lead (14 3 after three quarters) but lost 18 14 due to three crucial turnovers, ending the season with an 8 5 record.[67]
2012 season[edit]

Notre Dame opened their 2012 season with a special season opener in Dublin, Ireland. In the game, they defeated Navy 50 10.[71] Notre Dame won their week 2 game against Purdue at home, winning 20 17, on a field goal by sophomore Kyle Brindza. In week 3, Notre Dame defeated #10 Michigan State by a score of 20 3.[72][73] In week 4, #11 Notre Dame defeated #18 Michigan by a score of 13 6, recovering six turnovers in the process.[74] The Irish defeated Miami, #17 Stanford, and BYU before playing Oklahoma.[75] At 7 0, Notre Dame traveled to Norman and defeated #8 Oklahoma 30 13, only the fifth home loss for the Sooners under Bob Stoops.[76] On November 3, the Irish narrowly avoided an upset by beating Pittsburgh 29 26 in three overtimes. Notre Dame had rallied from a fourth quarter deficit of 14 points to tie the game late in regulation.[77] On November 10, #4 ranked Notre Dame traveled to Boston College and faced a team known for spoiling Notre Dame perfect seasons. Notre Dame won 21 6, not allowing Boston College to score a touchdown and improving to 10 0.[78] On November 17, Notre Dame went undefeated at home for the first time since 1998 with a 38 0 victory over Wake Forest.[79] On November 18, following the losses of #1 Kansas State and #2 Oregon, Notre Dame was voted the #1 team in the nation for the first time since 1993 and was #1 in the BCS rankings for the first time ever.[80] With a 22 13 defeat of USC, Notre Dame finished the regular season 12 0.[81] On Monday, January 7, 2013, Kelly and the Fighting Irish lost, 42 14, to the Alabama Crimson Tide in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game.[82] Kelly's Irish finished the season ranked #3 in the USA Today Coaches poll and #4 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll.[83] In 2014, Notre Dame discovered that an athletic trainer had provided impermissible help to eight players during this and the following season. Notre Dame reported this violation to the NCAA, and was then controversially forced on November 22, 2016, to vacate all of their 2012 (and 2013) victories,[84] finishing the season with an adjusted record of 0 1, after the NCAA rejected Notre Dame's appeal on February 13, 2018.[85] Kelly earned AFCA Coach of the Year, AP Coach of the Year, Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year, Bear Bryant Coach of the Year, Walter Camp Coach of the Year, and Home Depot Coach of the Year for his 2012 season.[86][87][88][89][90][91]

2013 season[edit]
The Spring of the 2013 season saw Notre Dame lose its starting quarterback Everett Golson for academic violations[92](later revealed to be cheating on a test[93][94]) leading Brian Kelly to name Tommy Rees as the starting quarterback.[95] Notre Dame opened the season playing Temple and won 28 6.[96] The following week was against Michigan in Ann Arbor[97][98] with Notre Dame losing 30 41. Due to academic violations, Notre Dame was controversially forced on November 22, 2016, to vacate all nine of their 2013 victories,[84] finishing the season with an adjusted record of 0 4, after the NCAA rejected Notre Dame's appeal on February 13, 2018.[85]
2014 season[edit]
In 2014, #17 Notre Dame started off the season with a 48 17 victory over Rice.[99] In the next game, they defeated Michigan by a score of 31 0. [100] The team won their next four games to go to 6 0 and a #5 ranking. The Irish dropped their matchup with #2 Florida State 31 27.[101] The Irish closed the season by losing four of the next five games before upsetting LSU 31 28 in the Music City Bowl to finish 8 5.[102][103]
2015 season[edit]
Notre Dame started the season with a #11 ranking in the AP Poll.[104] They opened their 2015 season against Texas with a 38 3 win.[105] During the game, starting running back Tarean Folston sustained an injury to his right knee ending his season.[106] In the following game against Virginia, starting quarterback Malik Zaire suffered a broken ankle [107] leading to DeShone Kizer finishing the game for Notre Dame. Kizer remained the Notre Dame quarterback for the rest of the season, a campaign in which the Irish won 10 games against 3 losses, the latter including a hard-fought loss to #7 Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl.[108][104]
2016 season[edit]
Notre Dame's season started with #10 ranking in the AP Poll. Their first game was a back-and-forth 2OT 50 47 loss to Texas.[109] Kelly's Irish lost three games in which they held a double-digit first-half lead, while also losing three games to teams who were not bowl-eligible in 2016.[110] In particular, Kelly faced criticism after a 10 3 loss to NC State. In this game, Kelly called 31 passing plays in Hurricane Matthew, resulting in 17 incompletions, five sacks, and only 113 yards of total offense.[111] Notre Dame brought about a change in their defense by firing their defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder after a 38 35 home loss to Duke.[112] In 2016, Notre Dame finished 4 8, which was its worst record in a decade.[113]
2017 season[edit]
The Irish were considered to be playoff contenders for the majority of the season despite a 20 19 early loss to the Georgia Bulldogs, who went on to win the SEC Championship.[114][115] The Irish continued to do well on the strength of running back and Heisman Trophy hopeful Josh Adams's performance.[116] The Irish were 8 1 before dropping two of their last three games to Miami and Stanford.[117] In 2017, the Irish bounced back from a 4 8 season by going 10 3, including a win over the #16 LSU Tigers in the Citrus Bowl.[118]The team had two offensive linemen drafted in the top 10 of the 2018 NFL Draft, Quenton Nelson by the Indianapolis Colts and Mike McGlinchey by the San Francisco 49ers.[119]
2018 season[edit]
The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24 17.[120] The Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech,  #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern.[121] This led to Notre Dame's first undefeated regular season since 2012.[122] They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee as of December 2, 2018, and selected to play in the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic against Clemson on December 29, 2018.[123] Notre Dame's undefeated streak came to an end after losing to Clemson 30 3 to finish the season at 12 1.[124] He was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.[125][126]

The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47 40 in 2OT[132] However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34 10.[133] He was named as the ACC Coach of the Year.[134] Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4-seed.[135] In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31 4 to give Kelly a 10 2 mark in the 2020 season.[136]
2021 season[edit]
In Kelly's 11th season, the Fighting Irish were ranked in the top 10 after a playoff appearance in 2020.[137] However, they struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41 38 and Toledo 32 29 before winning over Purdue 27 13 and 18th-ranked Wisconsin at Soldier Field 41 13.[138][139][140][141] Following a 24 13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the season.[142][137] After finishing the regular season with eleven wins and one loss, Kelly resigned from his position at Notre Dame in order to become the head coach of the LSU Tigers football team.[143]
Kelly finished his tenure at Notre Dame with a 92 39 record.[n 1]
LSU[edit]
On November 30, 2021, Kelly was named the 33rd head coach at Louisiana State University (LSU), replacing Ed Orgeron.[144][145] Kelly cited "wanting to be with the best" and "the commitment to excellence, rich traditions, and unrivaled pride and passion of LSU Football" for the move.[146][147]
