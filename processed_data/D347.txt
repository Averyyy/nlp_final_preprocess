Geography and environment[edit]
Wilton is located at 38 24 34 N 121 13 27 W  /  38.40944 N 121.22417 W  / 38.40944; -121.22417 (38.409556, -121.224264).[2]  According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 29.0 square miles (75 km2), all of it land.
Historically the Wilton vicinity has been a locale of considerable haying and pasture usage; the depth to groundwater is typically about 150 to 175 feet (46 to 53 meters).
Wilton lies partially in the floodplain of the Cosumnes River. Because some areas of Wilton are in a flood zone, water can be in the streets during the rainy season. In 1997, an El Nino/La Nina year, levees broke and some homes were flooded to the rooftops. On New Years Eve of 2022, parts of Wilton were evacuated due to a flood warning after levee breaches on the Cosumnes River.[3]
