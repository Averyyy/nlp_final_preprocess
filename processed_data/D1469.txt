Type of medical classification
This article is about the system of medical classification. For procedural code as used in computer programming, see Procedural programming.
Procedure codes are a sub-type of medical classification used to identify specific surgical, medical, or diagnostic interventions. The structure of the codes will depend on the classification; for example some use a numerical system, others alphanumeric.
