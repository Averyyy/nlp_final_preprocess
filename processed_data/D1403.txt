Controversy[edit]
In January, 2007, Dell was sued under claims that the laptops suffered premature failure of the motherboard due to overheating shortly after the warranty period had ended. The suit, which seeked class-action status, had been filed in Ontario Canada. The model numbers that suffered from this malady, were the Inspiron series which included model numbers 1100, 1150, 5100, 5150 and 5160. [2]
