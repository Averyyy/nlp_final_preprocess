Type of tattoo
 Footballer Ricardo Quaresma with teardrop tattoos below his right eye
The teardrop tattoo or tear tattoo is a symbolic tattoo of a tear that is placed underneath the eye. The teardrop is one of the most widely recognised prison tattoos[1] and has various meanings.
It can signify that the wearer has spent time in prison,[2][3] or more specifically that the wearer was raped while incarcerated and tattooed by the rapist as a "property" mark and for humiliation, since facial tattoos cannot be concealed.[4][5][6][7]
The tattoo is sometimes worn by the female companions of prisoners in solidarity with their loved ones.[8] Amy Winehouse had a teardrop drawn on her face in eyeliner after her husband Blake entered the Pentonville prison hospital following a suspected drug overdose.[9]
It can acknowledge the loss of a friend or family member: Basketball player Amar'e Stoudemire has had a teardrop tattoo since 2012 honouring his older brother Hazell Jr., who died in a car accident.[10]
In West Coast gang culture (USA), the tattoo may signify that the wearer has killed someone[11][12]  and in some of those circles, the tattoo's meaning can change: an empty outline meaning either the wearer attempted murder or that a fellow gang member or friend died and when filled in, the wearer sought revenge.[13][14]
Sometimes the exact meaning of the tattoo is known only by the wearer:[12][15]
Portuguese footballer Ricardo Quaresma has never explained his teardrop tattoos.[16]
