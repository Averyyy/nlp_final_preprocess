Kennywood is an amusement park which is located in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, just southeast of Pittsburgh. The park opened on May 30, 1899, as a trolley park attraction at the end of the Mellon family's Monongahela Street Railway.[1][2]
It was purchased in 1906 by F. W. Henninger and Andrew McSwigan, both of whom later formed the family-owned Kennywood Entertainment Company. The company later sold Kennywood, along with four other parks, in 2007 to Parques Reunidos, an international entertainment operator based in Spain.[6]
The amusement park features various structures and rides dating back to the early 1900s. Along with Rye Playland Park, it is one of two amusement parks in the United States designated as a National Historic Landmark. Kennywood is also one of thirteen trolley parks in the United States that remain in operation.
Location[edit]
Kennywood is approximately 8 miles (13 km) from Downtown Pittsburgh, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. The park is along Pennsylvania Route 837 (Green Belt), known as Kennywood Boulevard as it passes through the borough. The closest Interstate connection is Exit 77 (Edgewood/Swissvale) on Interstate 376.[7] The Mon Fayette Expressway will eventually go past Kennywood, which will prompt an expansion of the park when it is built.[8]
Historically, the park is on the location of the July 9, 1755 Battle of the Monongahela, where British general Edward Braddock was mortally wounded, ending his expedition to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. George Washington was a colonel to Braddock, and fought at the battle before they retreated.[9] Later the land on the bluff above the Monongahela River was part of a farm owned by Anthony Kenny. Starting around the time of the American Civil War, the site was a popular picnic grove for locals, known as "Kenny's Grove".[9]
History[edit]
 Andrew S. McSwigan.
A tree-filled portion of a farm owned by Anthony Kenny, known as "Kenny's Grove" overlooking the Monongahela River near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was a popular picnic spot for local residents since the American Civil War. In 1898, the Monongahela Street Railways Company, partially owned by prominent banker Andrew Mellon, seeking to increase fare profits on the weekends, leased the land from the Kenny family in order to create a trolley park at the end of their line.[9] The company's chief engineer, George S. Davidson, designed the original layout of the park and served as its first manager. A carousel, casino hall, and dance pavilion were added in 1899. A bandstand was constructed in 1900, while the Old Mill was constructed in 1901, and the park's first roller coaster, the Figure Eight Toboggan, was added in 1902.[9][10]
After less than a decade, the trolley company no longer wanted to manage the park. The standing manager, Andrew S. McSwigan, along with partners Frederick W. Henninger and A. F. Meghan, leased and operated the park as Kennywood Park Limited beginning in 1906.[9]
 Wonderland building, c. 1906
From its origin as a working-class picnic entertainment destination, the park grew in the first half of the twentieth century into a popular attraction that combined thrill rides with recreation venues such as swimming pools and dance halls.
Kennywood ceased to be served by streetcar when Mon Street Railways successor Pittsburgh Railways Company converted the route serving it, the lengthy #68 Duquesne-McKeesport line, to bus on September 15, 1958.
Today, the park features a nostalgic atmosphere and is supported by a loyal fan base. As of December 2007, Kennywood Entertainment also ran Sandcastle Waterpark [2], which opened in 1989; Idlewild Park [3] near Ligonier; Story Land [4], a children's theme park in Glen, New Hampshire; and Lake Compounce [5], New England's family theme park in Bristol, Connecticut, which is the oldest continuously operating amusement park in North America.
On December 12, 2007, Kennywood Entertainment announced that it would be selling Kennywood Park, along with Sandcastle Waterpark and four other amusement parks in the Northeastern United States, to Parques Reunidos, a company based in Madrid, Spain.[6]
Kennywood now uses the slogans  Welcome to the Family , "America's Finest Traditional Amusement Park", and "Make a New Memory", although from the 1960s through the early 1990s the slogan was "The Roller Coaster Capital of the World" (a title which is now being used by Cedar Point). The property features three old wooden roller coasters still in working order, along with three newer steel coasters, the Phantom's Revenge (2001) and the Sky Rocket (2010), The Steel Curtain (2019), and one indoor coaster, the Exterminator (1999).

Recognition[edit]
For the past several years, Kennywood has been rated the "Favorite 'Dark Attraction Park'" by the Darkride And Funhouse Enthusiasts, or DAFE.[16]
It ranked second to Cedar Point in the category of "Favorite Park" in Theme Park Magazine's 2004 Reader's Choice Awards.[17]
The park was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987.[5][18]
Attractions[edit]
 Main gates to Kennywood
Themed areas[edit]
Kiddieland was one of the first children's ride areas in the world, featuring all the rides in the park's diverse array of young child-specific rides in a compact area between the Auto Race and the Aero 360. Rides include miniature versions of the Turtle, Wave Swinger, Phantom's Revenge, Cosmic Chaos, Whip, and Merry-Go-Round. It is located next to the edge of the cliff on the river-view side of the park. It was originally located next to the Jack Rabbit before moving to its current location in 1927.
Lost Kennywood, which was added to the park in 1995, was built on the old sunlite pool/pay parking lot area. The area references Kennywood's long history, including its short-lived rival Luna Park (1905 1909), and also the illusion of yesteryear's dangerous rides. The area includes the Pittsburg  Plunge, the Whip, the Bavarian Wave Swinger, the Exterminator, the Black Widow, and the Swing Shot. Older rides which have been removed from Lost Kennywood since its opening include the Phantom Phlyers, Roll-O-Plane, the Pitt Fall 251-foot (77 m)-drop tower ride and WipeOut. The gateway to Lost Kennywood is a one-third scale replica of Luna Park's main entrance which spells Pittsburgh with no 'H', because in 1905 1909, the name of Pittsburgh was commonly spelled that way.
Thomas Town based around Thomas the Tank Engine opened as an extension of Kiddieland on July 27, 2018, containing 4 new rides and a re-themed Kennywood Railroad. Based on the popular long-running British television series, Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends.
Steelers Country is themed around the Pittsburgh Steelers and includes a new roller coaster called Steel Curtain, which has the tallest inversion in the world and the most inversions in the United States. The area also includes a Steelers themed restaurant called the End Zone Cafe, and the Steelers Experience. Steel Curtain opened on July 13, 2019, and replaced the Log Jammer, a flume ride which closed on September 17, 2017.
Area 412 is an intergalactic themed area with two alien themed rides, Cosmic Chaos and Spinvasion, the latter of which replaces the park's former Enterprise attraction, the Volcano, which closed in 2020. This section is to be officially established in 2023 with Spinvasion's debut, replacing the old former Volcano Valley area.
Former[edit]
Volcano Valley was established in 2003 for the addition of a new ride that year, King Kahuna. The Enterprise was rethemed as the Volcano during the transformation of this section of the park. The section then featured the King Kahuna, Pirate, Volcano, and cement volcanoes that are capable of spewing smoke. King Kahuna was replaced with Kenny's Kabanas after the 2009 season. Volcano Valley was disestablished as a themed area in 2020 after the removal of Volcano with Pirate and Kenny's Kabanas becoming independent from a themed area. In 2023, the portion of the area that had Volcano will be part of Area 412 with Spinvasion being on that land.
Roller coasters[edit]
Kennywood has made use of the hilly Pittsburgh terrain to create coasters that wouldn't be feasible in some amusement parks. The Thunderbolt and the Jack Rabbit, both wooden coasters, place the lift chain in the middle of the ride, not at the beginning. In both cases, the car leaves the station and drops into a valley for its first hill. Phantom's Revenge uses the same valley as the Thunderbolt, where the Phantom's second drop passes through the supports of the Thunderbolt's first drop, making the second drop the longest and steepest drop in the ride.

Description
Jack Rabbit 
1920
Designed by Harry C. Baker; Built by John A. Miller
Wooden coaster
A wooden out-and-back roller coaster, which is one of the oldest operating coasters in the world. The Jack Rabbit is famous for its double dip element, which is a drop that levels out midway before dropping again. It is also among a few of the last roller coasters still in operation that restrains passengers with only a seatbelt.
Racer
1927
Designed by John A. Miller; Built by Charlie Mach
Wooden racing coaster
A wooden racing roller coaster built by the legendary John A. Miller. The track is a M bius loop layout, in which there is one continuous track shared by both trains. After returning to the station, each train has traveled half the track and ends on the opposite side from which it began.
Thunderbolt 
1968
Andy Vettel
Wooden coaster
A wooden roller coaster that originally opened as Pippin in 1924. Following a major renovation, it reopened as Thunderbolt in 1968. It was ranked as the "Ultimate Roller Coaster" and "King of Coasters" by the New York Times in 1974. A unique characteristic involves its lift hill, which, instead of being located near the beginning of the ride, occurs near the middle. No single riders are allowed on the ride due to the lateral forces riders experience on the ride's double helix.
Lil' Phantom
1996
Molina & Son's
Moli-Coaster [Low Park Model]
The park's kiddie coaster. Added in 1996, this is a modern coaster in the style of classic coasters manufactured by Allan Herschell. The park describes the coaster as the "little cousin" of Phantom's Revenge. The ride was rehabbed, overhauled, and rebuilt for the 2007 season.
Exterminator 
1999
Reverchon
Spinning Coaster
A spinning wild mouse roller coaster that also features dark ride elements and heavily themed scenery.
Phantom's Revenge 
2001
D. H. Morgan Manufacturing
Hyper Coaster
A steel Hyper Coaster model originally named Steel Phantom and manufactured by Arrow Dynamics. It was later renovated by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing, transforming the ride into Phantom's Revenge. The coaster, which makes heavy use of the surrounding terrain, has an unusual characteristic where the second drop exceeds the length of the first.
Sky Rocket
2010
Premier Rides
Sky Rocket I
An LSM launch roller coaster that propels riders from 0 to 50 mph (0 to 80 km/h) in three seconds. It was the first coaster at the park since 1991's Steel Phantom to feature inversions and the first to have a launch since 1980's Laser Loop.
Steel Curtain 
2019
S&S
Steel Looping Coaster
A record-breaking roller coaster themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL football team built in the former location of Log Jammer, a flume ride that closed in 2017. The 220-foot-tall ride (67 m) reaches a maximum speed of 75 mph (121 km/h) and features nine inversions  the most in North America and third most on any coaster in the Western Hemisphere. It also holds a world record for having the highest inversion at 197 feet (60 m).
Flat rides[edit]

Type/model
Description
Aero 360 
2000
Zamperla
Hawk 48
This ride is a modern, open-air version of the park's old Ranger ride and features the Kennywood arrows on the rotating arms. Seated on suspended seats with legs freely dangling, the arms swing back and forth in different directions   higher and higher with each pendulum motion. As momentum builds, the ride culminates by spinning riders the full 360 degrees 70 feet (21 m) through the air. After a few revolutions, the arms pause midair before they begin to spin opposite of their original directions.
Auto Race 
1930
Traver Engineering
Auto Train
Also known by several veterans as the Auto Ride, this ride is the last of its kind and was designed by Harry Traver of the Traver Engineering Company. Electric cars run through a trough-like wooden track that twists and turns. When the ride opened in 1930, it had several small hills placed in the track, but these were soon removed to avoid rear-end collisions that were caused when cars could not get up and over them on rainy days. Again to avoid rear-end collisions, the ride was fully computer automated and the cars slowed down for the 2014 season.
Black Widow 
2012
Zamperla
Giant Discovery
The ride seats 40 people in a circle and swings riders back and forth like a pendulum while the disc spins, reaching speeds up to 68 miles per hour (109 km/h). The ride structure stands at 90 feet (27 m) and at the peak of the pendulum's swing height riders will hang 146 feet (45 m) off the ground. The ride replaced the Pitt Fall drop tower ride.
Cosmic Chaos 
2007
Zamperla
Mega Disk'O
The ride seats 24 people on a giant disk. Riders sit upon motorcycle-like pedestal seats with back restraints. Arms and legs are free from restraint and the passenger faces outward. To a top height of 50 feet (15 m), the disk begins its untamed flight along the 120 foot (37 m) concave track while its passengers spin around in a circle. The ride was repainted with a new color scheme in 2023 to coincide with the area being rethemed as Area 412 and the opening of Spinvasion.
Gran Prix 
1973
Reverchon
Bumper Cars
The ride was added as a replacement for the Skooter bumper car ride and eliminated the need for a center divider and one way traffic. It runs 40 two-passenger cars, one of which, #31, is painted black and gold in honor of Mike Logan of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, who mentioned the park after the Steelers won Super Bowl XL. It is one of four rides at Kennywood with a ride start/stop bell and its bell was actually salvaged from the Skooter building, which was Kennywood's previous bumper car ride which closed in 1979. Riders steer their cars in any direction across the metal rectangular floor bumping other cars out of their way.
Kangaroo
1962
John Norman Bartlett
Flying Coaster
The last ride of its kind; purchased in 1962. During the ride, eight cars travel a circular track with a single steep hill. After "bouncing" off the top of the hill, the cars then make a slow descent in midair back down to the track, giving each guest the sensation of flying. Its resemblance of a Kangaroo's leap is what inspired its name. Kennywood announced on 3 November 2020 the removal of the Kangaroo, along with three other flat rides.[19] The announcement was met with outrage from park guests and local media alike, and a petition was circulated to save the Kangaroo and also-retired-Paratrooper from removal, which gathered more than 20,000 signatures.[20] On 19 November 2021, Kennywood announced the return of the Kangaroo due to popular demand, in which it will be reconstructed for the 2022 season following a refurbishment.[21][22]
Merry-Go-Round 
1927
William H. Dentzel
Carousel
Referred to simply as the carousel by many, the Merry Go Round is a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark and is Kennywood's third and largest carousel. Originally commissioned by the U.S. Government for the 1926 Philadelphia Sesqui-Centennial Exposition, it was not completed in time and was purchased by Kennywood. It is also the last carousel that was ever built by William Dentzel. There are 50 jumping and 14 stationary horses. The only two non-horse animals featured on the ride are the tiger and the lion. It is one of four rides at Kennywood with a ride start/stop bell that dates back to the origin of the ride and features over 1500 lights.
Music is provided by a 1916 Wurlitzer style #153 Military Band Organ, which is the oldest of its kind in existence, and possibly the first of more than 140 style #153 organs built between 1916 and 1936.
During Phantom Fright Nights, the carousel is filled with fog and various figures are placed on the outer row of animals. During Holiday Lights, the carousel is decorated in wreaths and garland, with red and green lights, and Christmas music playing on the band organ.
Musik Express 
1987
Mack Rides
Music Express
Musik Express is a quick circular ride that travels clockwise around an undulating track. It has a white/red loading/running lighting theme, respectively. The ride has a 1960s/1970s rock theme to it with yellow and green being the theme colors of the ride. During Phantom Fright Nights, Halloween themed music is played.
Pirate 
1982
Huss
Pirate Ship
This is a large pirate-themed boat suspended from a giant "A" frame structure mounted to a trailer. The trailer is hidden behind a retaining wall surrounded by landscaping. The boat swings back and forth until it achieves a height of 60 feet (18 m) and is at a 75-degree angle with its initial resting position, giving riders the sensation of weightlessness. Originally the "helm" of the ship was facing the road, but after Kennywood renovated the ride under Huss's supervision, the direction of the boat was flipped so that the "helm' now faces Noah's Ark.
Spinvasion
2023
Zamperla
Gryphon
This ride is the first Zamperla Gryphon ever built in the U.S. It is sort of a modernized version of the park's former Swing Around ride. Riders are arranged single-file around and suspended from a central wheel. As the wheel spins, the seats swing outward parallel to the ground in different patterns, turning the riders sideways. It is themed to an alien invasion similarly to its neighbor, Cosmic Chaos. It is the first addition of the brand new Area 412 park zone.
Swing Shot 
2006
S&S Worldwide
Air-Launched Screamin' Swing
One of the first 32-passenger models of the S&S Screamin' Swing to debut. Two 16-passenger arms swing riders back and forth with pneumatic power, reaching a height of 90 feet (27 m) at a 120 degree angle and reaching speeds of 50 mph (80 km/h). This ride stands where the WipeOut once stood. Initially the ride was plagued with downtime due to the plastic air chambers leaking. Since installing the redesigned steel air tanks, the ride has been more reliable. The ride's name was chosen through an online "Name the Ride" contest in September 2005.[23] In 2023, the ride was repainted with a new color scheme reminiscent of the colors of the ride's logo.
Turtle
1927
Traver Engineering Company
Tumble Bug
This is ride follows an undulating track with six cars that travel counter-clockwise on a circular track over a series of three hills and dips. Originally called the Tumble Bug, the ride featured bug-themed cars until it received new turtle-like exteriors in 1948. The Turtle is the only operating ride of its kind left in existence.
Wave Swinger 
1984
Zierer
Wave Swinger 48
This ride is a trailer-mounted wicker swing ride with the trailer placed in a pit to make the ride flush to the ground and ADA accessible, unlike the usual trailer setup. It has a white/red loading/running lighting theme, respectively, and features a painting in the center of a decorative molding on each exterior panel. The swing chairs were replaced in 2019.
Whip
1926
W.F. Mangels
16 CarWhip
It is the oldest flat ride in the park and the last operating 16 car whip. Replacing a 1919 12-car model, the current ride's 16 cars travel along an oblong track and "whip" as they go around the bend at either end. Originally near the Thunderbolt, the ride along with its pavilion was relocated near the then Pony Track when the Pippin was extended into the Thunderbolt in 1968. The Whip was relocated from that pavilion near the Log Jammer to Lost Kennywood in 1995 and is one of four rides in Kennywood with a ride start/stop bell that dates back to the origin of the ride. In 2002, a park guest was killed when the ride's pavilion collapsed during a microburst. The pavilion has not been rebuilt, but replaced with a white wooden fence and surrounded by flagpoles. The openness of the ride makes it unique as most Whips are sheltered under pavilions.

During the regular season, it features the "San Andreas 4D Experience" and "Thomas & Friends 4-D: Bubbling Boilers". During Phantom Fright Nights the movie is changed to a compilation of Friday the 13th films. For Christmas, an abbreviated version of "The Polar Express" and the reimagined version of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" is shown. There is an air conditioned waiting room, and a gift shop attached. Due to COVID-19, the theater has been closed since 2020.
Ghostwood Estate  
2008
Halloween Productions/ETF Ride Systems
Trackless interactive dark ride
Riders enter the dilapidated estate through the study of Lord Kenneth Ghostwood, the owner of the manor. Suddenly, the ghostly image of Lord Ghostwood literally forces himself out of his portrait. He informs riders that following his death, his home became overrun with spirits and how he requires the guests' help to drive them away so that he may regain his solitude. In return, he offers the guest who rids the most ghosts from his estate an invitation to spend eternity with him in the mansion. The riders then walk up a flight of stairs to the house's balcony and board the trackless four passenger "Ghost Buggies". Each guest is provided with a "Ghost Blaster" to help them eliminate the ghosts. The eight room haunted mansion features animatronics, props, elaborate sets, and computer-generated animation. Guests compete with each other by shooting their blasters at over 200 targets which activate different props. Each prop activated adds to the rider's scores, shown on a display in each car.
Noah's Ark
1936
Herbert Paul Schmeck of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company
Noah's Ark
A walk-through dark attraction. Patrons walk through an ark recreating Noah's attempt at bringing animals aboard. This ride, the last operating of its kind in the world, was remodeled in 1996 by R&R Creative Amusement Designs with the brand new storyline of guests taking a tour of an archeological dig site following the "discovery" of Noah's Ark. During the remodeling, the Ark was entirely rebuilt due to structural problems with the original "boat". Instead of entering through a whale's mouth, patrons boarded an old industrial service elevator that provided the effect of rising, then falling down the shaft and crashing underground. Part of the re-theming of the ride included props meant to appear like ancient artifacts that were found below the Ark. This version of the Ark also had a finale where guests would stand inside a steel-walled chamber meant to be a bathysphere designed to take riders back up to the "surface". Streams of water would begin to burst through walls and flood the chamber. Due to technical difficulties, the ride's path was rerouted and the bathysphere room was blocked off in 2011. One popular classic gags, the shaker boards, still remained in this version of the Ark. In the winter of 2015 16, the Ark was entirely remodeled to be more like its 1969-1995 state, including the famed whale's mouth entrance, in conjunction with the ride's 80th anniversary. Older gags that were removed in the 1996 renovation of the Ark that were re-added include air jets that were previously used to blow air up women's skirts, but now are simply used to catch guests off-guard.
Old Mill
1901
Kennywood Park/The ScareHouse
Old Mill
This is the oldest ride at Kennywood, originally constructed in 1901 though it has gone through numerous major theme and structural changes throughout its existence. The scenes inside this vintage dark attraction have featured "gorgeous grottos" and continents from around the world including Hawaii and Australia. This attraction featured scenery of a mine haunted by ghosts, ghouls, and skeletons, as well as three outdoor scenes. Various names have accompanied the different themes over the years, including the "Panama Canal", "Hardheaded Harold's Horrendously Humorous Haunted Hideaway", and "Garfield's Nightmare".

Shoot the Chute
The centerpiece attraction in Lost Kennywood, this is a Shoot-the-Chute ride named for the brief period in the 1890s when Pittsburgh dropped the "h" from its name. The ride has three 20-passenger boats, though only two usually operate at a time. The boats are designed to resemble the shoot-the-chute boats of old amusement parks. Each boat is lifted to the top of the ride by a lift hill before making a 180-degree turn and descending the 50-foot drop and splashing down into a landing pool. The wave created by the boat's splashdown soaks both the passengers as well as nearby onlookers with water.
Raging Rapids 
1985
Intamin
River Rapids
This ride was opened in 1985 and simulates a white-water rafting trip through canyons and beneath waterfalls. Three pumps are constantly filling the cement trough with 93,000 gallons of water each minute. During the first season, the first holding pool had an operating wave machine. Since 1986, wooden guide rails have sent rafts continuously through the former wave pool without stoppage. The gates at the exit of the pool are constantly held open and the wave machine is still visible, but deactivated. Also, shortly before the lift at the end of the ride there used to be a figure of a man aiming a water gun at passengers. This effect is no longer part of the ride.

Miniature Train
A 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge[25] train ride along the top of the cliff at the rear of the park with various displays and a recording that tells about park history (prior to the 2009 season, it also told Western Pennsylvania history). The locomotives are from the 1939 New York World's Fair, have a gasoline-powered engine, and were installed in the park in 1945. The ride had many previous names in the past including "Little Choo Choo", "Hoot N' Holler Railroad", and, "The Olde Kennywood Railroad". The crossing sign, tunnel, and Raging Rapids Overlook were removed in 2012. The rocking train, originally featured on the roof of the station, was rebuilt in 2013. It was re-themed to Thomas the Tank Engine in 2018 as part of the Thomas Town area.

Added in 2001, this ride kicked off a rehabilitation and expansion project for Kiddieland. Placed on a new midway that replaced the Safety City truck ride, this is a miniature version of the park's former Flying Carpet ride. It is themed to the Kennywood trolley that leads the Fall Fantasy parades and roams the streets of Pittsburgh (a new bus in different colors was purchased in 2008). Adults may ride.
Dizzy Dynamo
1970
San Antonio Roller Works
A unique ride, in which riders sit in one of eight cars mounted to a circular platform. As the platform begins to spin, so does each individual car, in alternating directions.

Riders sat in one of the sixteen cars that travel at a high speed around a circular, single-hilled track. Riders start in an upright position and as the cars pick up speed, they tilt inward toward the center of the ride. This ride was also known for its loud air horn which, along with the sound of the moving vehicles, was reminiscent of a diesel train. A popular ride since 1971, this was the third Bayern Kurve that the park has installed, being in the park since 1994 and removed for refurbishment from 2005 to 2008. Kennywood announced the removal of the Bayern Kurve on 3 November 2020.[19] The ride was sold to California's Great America to be used as a parts donor for their Bayern Kurve ride, the Berserker.

When Le Cachot was re-designed from Safari, they added 10 feet to the rear of the building and reconfigured the track. Le Cachot, French for "The Dungeon" featured skeletons in a 70's motif. The warrior from the Safari ride was replaced with two skeletons: one was riding a motorcycle, one was playing a guitar.[27] After the 1998 season, Kennywood closed the doors on Le Cachot. A common misconception is that the ride was removed due to a fire. The stunts were sold off and the Pretzel cars went to Bushkill Park in Easton, PA, where they now carry riders through that park's very old Haunted Pretzel ride. During the tear down of the ride, the building did catch fire.[28]

Originally designed with a spiral lift taking the cars from the station on the ground level to the show scenes on the second floor, the station was rebuilt above the midway where it could be reached by stairs next to the Raging Rapids. This was done to eliminate the problems experienced with the lift. It was removed during the 2007 season to make way for Ghostwood Estate. Props from the Gold Rusher have been used as part of Death Valley during Phantom Fright Nights as well as during Idlewild Park's Hallowboo! before being placed in the 2020 revision of the Old Mill. The ride system was originally intended to be donated to the same park as the Flying Carpet, but the offer was turned down and it was eventually sold on eBay.

Log Flume
A fiberglass log flume water ride which ran through the wooded area in the back of the park. It was the park's first multimillion-dollar project, built in 1975 and consisting of two lifts, the first being 27 feet (8.2 m) high, and one leading to the ride's final and biggest 53-foot (16m) high drop. The ride was notable for being the last log flume in existence to have a spillway drop, an element where the ride boat travels down a drop before rising into a brief uphill section. The Log Jammer's final day of operation was September 17, 2017.[29] In 2019, Steel Curtain and Steelers Country opened on the land where Log Jammer once stood.

The ride became infamous over time for being a rough and uncomfortable experience. In early 2000, Kennywood announced Steel Phantom would close on September 4. The ride was initially intended to be completely removed from the park, but due to public backlash, the park made the decision to hire D. H. Morgan Manufacturing to improve Steel Phantom by removing its inversions, adding airtime hills, increasing its drop height and speed, increasing the track length, and building new trains with lap bar restraints instead of over-the-shoulder harnesses. The ride reopened in 2001 as Phantom's Revenge.

Electric Cars
An antique car ride formerly located right at the front of the park. This attraction originally debuted with gasoline powered cars and was sponsored by Gulf Oil. However, in 1987 these cars were removed and replaced with electric cars manufactured by Morgan. When it was created, it was a major investment for the park because the tracks could not be removed and the park owners did not yet own the land the park was built on. The price of gas at the Turnpike's gas station was read as "FUN", no matter what grade of fuel. It was removed in 2009, though the park stated in an official announcement that plans are underway to bring back the Turnpike within the next few seasons. The Sky Rocket is in its place.

This ride was originally called the Enterprise until the addition of the Volcano Valley themed area. As the Enterprise, the loading platform was surrounded by a blue railing and was raised by a retaining wall that was surrounded by shrubbery. As the Volcano, the shrubbery has been replaced with a mountain landscape that covers the original retaining wall and railing. It has 20 swinging gondolas, which travel in a circular clockwise motion on a large wheel. Once it achieves a fast enough speed, the wheel raises riders to a 90-degree angle and spins the riders upside down. In the past, this ride featured eruption-themed special effects including sound, fog, and lighting. Only the fog effect was still operational at the time of the ride's closure and was almost exclusively used during Phantom Fright Nights. The ride structure excluding the cars was replaced with an identical 1986 model from one of Kennywood's sister parks, Lake Compounce, in 2016.

In 1993, it temporarily replaced the Enterprise (now Volcano) while it was being rehabbed. In 1994, it was a similar placeholder for the Wave Swinger which was being rehabbed for its move to Lost Kennywood and ultimately replaced by the Kennyville Stage. Then in 1996, the ride found its first permanent home by the entrance to Lost Kennywood, between the Musik Express and Wave Swinger. In 2005, the Wipeout was transplanted one final time to the current location of the Bayern Kurve to make way for the installation of the Swingshot. Originally the Kurve was to be rehabbed over the winter, but due to issues with obtaining parts, the WipeOut was installed at its location and the Kurve was removed. 2008 would be the last season for the WipeOut since the Bayern Kurve was finally done with its lengthy overhaul and reinstalled at its former location for the 2009 season. The WipeOut was moved to Lake Compounce where it is operated until 2020 on the location of the park's former Music Express.
Wonder Wheel
1986 1999
Ferris Wheel
Removed to make room for Aero 360.
Zoomerang
1954 1960
Pretzel Amusement Ride Company, designed by Bill Cassidy
Pretzel Dark Ride
A cross-promotion with a local television show allows viewers to suggest a name for the ride. A group known as "Ida Mae & Happy" suggested the name of Zoomerang, more than likely because of the curves and the spinning. Ironically, the ride only spun for one season before maintenance workers bolted the spinning mechanism. This ride was later rebranded as the Safari in 1961.[31]
Notable landmarks and buildings[edit]
Object
Description
Cowboy Joe 
He is a famous Kennywood "visitor" who has been occupying his special bench in the park for decades. There is a sign behind him that reads "Swappin' yarns with Cowboy Joe at Kennywood." and park goers have been getting a picture taken with him since he first set foot in the park. In reality, this classic icon is but a fiberglass statue of a cowboy with glass eyes (replaced with paint-on-fiberglass eyes in 2009), mounted to a wooden bench. He used to hold a cigarette in his right hand, but quit smoking cold turkey after being stripped of his paint, patched, and repainted during 2008. His costume consists of a brown hat, boots, and vest; red button down shirt; and blue jeans. Also, he has gray hair and brown eyes. While his location within the park has changed, he himself remains very much the same.
Clown-Headed Garbage Cans 
They are a collection garbage cans usually located within Kiddieland that are topped with a colorfully costumed fiberglass clown head cap. Each clown has a hole in its wide open mouth through which guests deposit their garbage.
Dancing Waters 
This is the water fountain located between the Grand Prix and the Windmill, in what is probably the most beautiful and serene part of the park. Formerly located in front of the Wonder Wheel at the location of the Aero 360, It was created as a scaled-down replica of the fountain at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas and was choreographed to lights and music. The show features have since been abandoned leaving it as just a static fountain with spinning spray nozzles in the middle.
Kiddieland Fountain 
This fountain marks the side entrance to Kiddieland. Built on part of the site of the park's former Ghost Ship darkride, it is the centerpiece of a relaxing, shaded plaza where many guests sit to enjoy their food from the nearby refreshment stands.
Laffin' Sal 
She is a mechanical laughing woman sculpted from paper mache who greets guests with her cheerful gap-toothed smile and haunting laugh. She has been a Kennywood tradition since the opening of Laff in the Dark in 1931, created during the Great Depression to boost visitors' spirits. She is currently located in the arcade building. Before she moved to the arcade she was located in a window at the Olde Kennywood Railroad train station, being moved to accommodate the rethemeing of the train to Thomas the Tank Engine. Prior to that she was located at the entrance of the park's old Le Cachot dark ride. While her location and outfits change occasionally, she herself has retained the same looks as well as her original cackling laughter soundtrack. During Phantom Fright Nights, she is dressed as a witch and an even creepier and evil-sounding laugh soundtrack is played. Many people believe her to be the scariest attraction at Kennywood.
The Lagoon
This is a stunning water feature in the heart of the park featuring the paddle boats (formerly rowboats) and the Skycoaster. Several carnival games and food stands are adjacent to the Lagoon, as well as the Log Jammer, Aero 360, Jack Rabbit, and Racer. For decades there were twice daily circus acts performed in the middle of the Lagoon on the Lagoon Stage, however, the shows came to an end when the stage was converted to a loading platform for the Skycoaster for the 1994 season. In 2010 for the first time in 16 years, the Lagoon became host of a new show to close every night with when the Kennywood Laser Spectacular was added. For this nighttime finale, a new screen was installed on the Pastime Building and lasers, fog machines, and fire effects were placed in and around the Lagoon. In 2019, Steel Curtain's dive loop was built over the northern part of the lagoon.
Leo, The Paper Eating Lion 
Leo is a most unusual recycling bin. The device is shaped like a circus trailer and has a lion's head sculpted on the front. The lion's face has a large hole in the mouth where a vacuum aids in the disposal of paper products such as napkins, tissues, cigarette boxes, and cups. There is also a continuously looping audio track that is played in which Leo talks and roars. Leo is located in the heart of Kiddieland right next to the Dizzy Dynamo.
Lion Fountain 
It is a drinking fountain shaped like a Lion. It is located near the Kiddieland Bathrooms. When children take a drink from it, it looks as if the lion is going to bite their head off making it a humorous photo opportunity.
Lost Kennywood Fountain 
There is a spectacular fountain located in front of the Pittsburg  Plunge.  When the fountain was first completed in 1995, it was home to a nightly special effects show named Luna Phantastic featuring music, smoke, and pyrotechnics. However, this show was short lived, but many of the colored lights used in the show are still activated in the evening.  One part of the fountain is designed to replicate the one that existed in almost exactly the same place in the former swimming pool.
Mushroom Fountain 
It is a vintage drinking fountain shaped like a giant mushroom featuring four spigots, each at different heights for guests of all sizes. It is located between the Merry-Go-Round and Parkside Cafe.
Pagoda Refreshment Stand
The Pagoda is a refreshment stand with oriental architecture. The design of the stand was inspired by a similar pagoda restaurant at Tivoli Gardens in Denmark, though Kennywood's pagoda is only about half the height of Tivoli's. The stand's roof is decorated with 7,312 ceramic tiles and wooden dragon heads that were originally mounted to the front of the boats on the Old Mill.
Parkside Cafe
The Parkside Cafe is a dine-in restaurant that sits in the very center of the park. It's the oldest restaurant at Kennywood having opened as a casino in 1899 during the park's first year of operation. The cafe features entrees such as pasta dishes, chicken, shrimp, salads, hot and cold sandwiches, wraps, and desserts inside of an air-conditioned dining room as well as an outdoor patio. In 2022, the cafe began to sell beer, making it one of three locations in the park that serve alcohol.
The Potato Patch
First opening in 1973, it is one of Kennywood's most popular food stands which specializes in fresh-cut french fries. The stand was originally intended to serve fried chicken, but the main menu item was changed to fries for unknown reasons. The stand uses about four tons of potatoes per day and serves the fries with toppings such as cheddar cheese sauce, bacon bits, brown gravy, and a variety of seasonings.
Victorian Windmill 
There is a large decorative scaled-down windmill structure that stands in front of the park. At night, the four spinning blades are illuminated by hundreds of lights. The windmill is a wooden structure built on a stone foundation and is one of the oldest structures in the park. Formerly located in the middle of the lagoon, it was moved to the front of the park to make room for the Traver circle swing, better known as the Rocketships.
Entertainment[edit]
Entertainment is a focal point of Kennywood. Strolling musicians, live shows, and costumed characters are part of Kennywood's history. For the park's 100th anniversary in 1998, the park had side shows, magicians, and other events in their "centennial midway." During the 2008 season, the Kennyville Stage offered an act by Jason Pipatone   Master Entertainer as well as all day viewing of "Kenny TV", a closed circuit TV network displaying various videos and trivia. "Kenny TV" was at one time viewed at many other locations throughout the park, but the project was later abandoned and eventually removed. The Scheer's Lumberjack Show had a one-year run in 2008 replacing the "Pirates of Kenny Cove" high-dive show. In 2009, this location featured a show called Maximum Velocity, a BMX stunt show based on audience participation. The park also has strolling musicians and roaming mascots including the park's mascot, Kenny Kangaroo, who debuted in 1974.[citation needed] From 2001 up through the end of 2008, the comic characters Garfield and Odie also could be found at the park.
Nationality days[edit]
Nationality Days are several annual events, each spotlighting a different local culture. These include, but are not limited to, Irish Day, Greek Day, Serbian Day, Croatian Day, Polish Day, Slovak Day, Hungarian Day, and Italian Day. On these days some of the park's many picnic pavilions will be in use for entertainers of the particular day's nationality, including ethnic dancers.
Phantom Fall Fest[edit]
Originally called Phantom Fright Nights[32] until 2021, Phantom Fall Fest is a Halloween event held at Kennywood on Friday nights and all day Saturdays and Sundays during the month of October. The park traditionally opened at seven in the evening and closes at one in the morning. In 2015 the hours were changed from six until midnight. Then in 2021 the hours were change to Fridays from six to eleven, Saturdays from noon to eleven, and Sundays from noon to ten. The event began in 2002, though the concept of theming an amusement park for Halloween is not new. "Phantom Fright Nights" received third place in the Golden Ticket Awards for best Halloween event in 2007.
Labor Day traditionally marked the end of the season and the park would shut down until the spring. In 2002, Kennywood decided to break the long-standing tradition and turn almost half of the park into a giant Halloween extravaganza. The park's initial trial of Phantom Fright Nights in 2002 consisted of four traditional haunted houses, with only a few rides and roller coasters in operation. Despite the relatively limited scope of the opening year, the experiment proved to be a success, and new areas of the park and rides are opened for the festivities every year. In 2004 Kennywood debuted Gory Park, a haunted zone in Lost Kennywood. The following year, 2005, the park managed to have 3/4 of the rides and attractions operable due to high demand and record-breaking crowds. The park has reported attendance greater for one Fright Night than they have on a good normal operating day.
In the spirit of Halloween season, the park itself is given a complete make-over, with costumed actors roaming the paths, spooky music filling the air by dark wave bands Midnight Syndicate and Nox Arcana, and fog blanketing the park and every light bulb in the park is changed to a different color even the restroom windows are covered in colored films. The merry-go-round horse normally found in the fountain by the entrance is replaced by a giant Phantom-like figure with glowing red eyes hovering over bubbling red blood (dyed water). In some places, sheets are hung up and classic horror movies are played, such as the original "House on Haunted Hill". Several areas of the park, including Kiddieland and Lost Kennywood, are turned into open-air haunted attractions. Other buildings, such as the Penny Arcade and the Parkside Terrace Cafe, are converted into more traditional haunted houses. Some rides are given entirely new lighting and fog effects including strobes and blacklights, or in the Exterminator's case, an absolute absence of light. In the case of the Carousel and Musik Express, Halloween-themed music is all that is played. Even the entrance tunnel is affected; a great amount of fog is pumped into the passageway and chainsaw-wielding characters stalk unsuspecting guests as they enter. These ghouls are also found throughout the park when least expected. Starting in 2018 Kennywood added Happy Hauntings, a family friendly Halloween event during the daytime every Saturday and Sunday in October with Kiddieland, Thomas Town, and most of the rides opened along with kid friendly Halloween activities. In 2021, Happy Hauntings and Phantom Fright Nights merged into one event called Phantom Fall Fest.
Kennywood discourages children under the age of thirteen from attending the park during Phantom Fall Fest at night as the atmosphere may be too intense for some younger children, but letting children attend is solely at the discretion of parents or guardians. Many children go to Fright Nights anyway, even with the suggestion since Kennywood will admit attendees of any age.

Kennywood in the media[edit]
 A sign reading "Is Kennywood Open?" in a restroom at Eat'n Park near Pittsburgh Mills.
Kennywood's world-renowned reputation and nationwide popularity has led to its mention and appearance in many forms of media, including TV shows, movies, books, records, and has even warranted a reason to film a documentary about the park's history.
Television[edit]
Kennywood was mentioned in an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation entitled "Turn of the Screws", which dealt with a Las Vegas roller coaster derailment. CSI Supervisor Gil Grissom, who is a roller coaster enthusiast, tells the park engineer that he holds the marathon riding record on the Steel Phantom in Kennywood Park, Pennsylvania.
Kennywood was also mentioned on an episode of Without a Trace. They showed the park, but the name of it was not the same. It had the famous Steel Phantom in the park also.
After the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowl XL in 2006, Steelers safety Mike Logan, a native of McKeesport, Pennsylvania, near Kennywood, made a humorous riff on the "I'm going to Disney World!" advertising campaign usually associated with the Super Bowl, saying, "Forget Disney World, I want them to open up Kennywood!"
Singer/Actor Micky Dolenz, former drummer for The Monkees, often fondly tells audiences at his live shows that Kennywood was the location of his first ever public appearance. He appeared at Kennywood with his elephant in the 1950s when he was known as Circus Boy. The television series featured Micky as Corky, a boy who grows up on the road in a circus.
A scene of Kennywood can be seen in the Nickelodeon TV program Zoey 101 (ep. 62: "Roller Coaster") with a sign reading "Spine Twister" on the lift hill of the Phantom's Revenge.
The park appears in a season 2 episode of Shipping Wars in which shippers Christopher Hanna and Robbie Welsh were hired to transport the giant black widow spider figure that adorns the entrance of Black Widow from a theming company in New Jersey to Kennywood a few days prior to the ride's opening day. The ending scene of the episode shows Chris and Robbie riding the attraction.
Kennywood was featured on the July 29, 2022, episode of CBS's Secret Celebrity Renovation featuring Billy Gardell who goes to Kennywood while renovating his best friend s mom s house.
Movies[edit]
In the 1993 film Striking Distance, a poster for Kennywood's Fraternal Order of Police picnic day is visible inside a Pittsburgh Police station.
Footage of Kennywood's Musik Express was shown in the beginning of the 1994 film Only You. The Wonder Wheel was also featured in this movie.
The 2009 film Adventureland was filmed at Kennywood.
Parts of the 2022 film Dear Zoe was filmed at Kennywood.
Literature[edit]
Kennywood also served as the inspiration for "Joyland Park" in LJ Smith's teen horror novel The Forbidden Game: The Kill.
Kennywood served as the main inspiration for Jennifer Cruise and Bob Mayer's novel Wild Ride. The writers acknowledged the park by thanking "Kennywood for giving us a place to start thinking about Dreamland".
Music[edit]
In 1899, Kennywood commissioned the "Kennywood Park Waltz" and it was popular around the turn on the century. Kennywood would sell the sheet music in the park. It was composed by Margaretha Scandroll. It has only been professionally recorded once for the 2007 documentary "Welcome Back Riders". It was performed by the Bulgarian Tosheff Piano Duo.
In 1987, Rock 'n roll singer Freddy Cannon recorded a slightly remade version of his 1962 hit "Palisades Park" called "Kennywood Park", featuring attractions at Kennywood. The song was released on a limited-edition 45 vinyl pressing and sold as a $1.99 fundraising item for Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital through the now-defunct National Record Mart.[34] The record is considered by some to be a collector's item today.[citation needed]
Documentary[edit]
On September 28, 1988, the local PBS station, WQED, first aired Kennywood Memories, a one-hour documentary about Kennywood. Rick Sebak narrated. Although many of the rides mentioned are since defunct, the historic information about the park is still quite relevant.
Kennywood was featured in the 2007 documentary "Welcome Back Riders".
Park police[edit]
Kennywood employs weapon-certified security officers that have the ability to make arrests that are supported by the district's local police force. A famous case resulting from a 1986 arrest of a park visitor for drug possession went all the way to the Pennsylvania Superior Court in 1988, which ruled in favor of the park's security force. The defendant had unsuccessfully attempted to have the evidence suppressed.[35]
