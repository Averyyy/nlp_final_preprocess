In March 2015, Ryan revealed that she had once been in an abusive relationship, though she described it as a professional relationship rather than a romantic one.[64] She explained that "it was such emotional manipulation to the point where it became physical", and the experience inspired her to team up with Mary Kay and Love is Respect for their "Don't Look Away" anti-domestic violence campaign.[65]

I love singing it. I also love country! My brother loves rock; he also has this chill Jason Mraz-like style. So basically, my answer is: jazz-country-rock-alternative? I have no idea! But I honestly would love to make country music."
