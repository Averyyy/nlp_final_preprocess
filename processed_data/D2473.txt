The NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament is a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 women's college basketball teams from the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), to determine the national championship.
The tournament was preceded by the AIAW women's basketball tournament, which was organized by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) from 1972 to 1982. Basketball was one of 12 women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981 82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the AIAW for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same 12 (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA prevailed, while the AIAW disbanded.
As of 2022, the tournament follows the same format and selection process as its men's counterpart, with 32 automatic bids awarded to the champions of the Division I conferences, and 36 "at-large bids" extended by the NCAA Selection Committee, which are placed into four regional divisions and seeded from 1 to 16. The four lowest-seeded automatic bids, and the four lowest-seeded at-large bids, compete in the First Four games to advance to the 64-team bracket in the first round. The national semi-finals, branded as the Women's Final Four, are traditionally scheduled on the same weekend as the men's Final Four, but in a different host city. Presently, the Women's Final Four uses a Friday/Sunday scheduling, with its games occurring one day prior to the men's Final Four and championship respectively.[1]
Attendance and interest in the women's championship have grown over the years, especially from 2003 to 2016, when the final championship game was moved to the Tuesday following the Monday men's championship game.[1] The tournament is often overshadowed by the more-prominent men's tournament; after a gender equality review following the 2021 tournament, the NCAA  expanded it to the current 68-team format of the men's tournament, and extended the "March Madness" branding to the tournament as well. Still, the tournament receives a smaller amount of funding from broadcast rights (which are held by ESPN, and are pooled with those of other NCAA Division I championships besides golf and men's basketball) and sponsorship (which are sold by CBS and Turner Sports) than the men's tournament.
With 11 national titles, the UConn Huskies hold the record for the most NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championships, which included four straight championships from 2013 through 2016.[2] The team had also made the semi-finals for 14 consecutive tournaments.
Tournament format[edit]
From 1982 to 1990, 1996 to 2002, 2017 to 2019 and since 2021, the Women's Final Four is usually played on the Friday before the Men's Final Four or the hours before the men played on the final Saturday of the tournament. The final, since 2023, is played the Sunday afternoon following the Men's Final Four; from 2017 to 2019, 2021 and 2022, Sunday evening.
The tournament bracket is made up of champions from each Division I conference, which rre somatic bid]]s. The remaining slots are at-large bids, with teams chosen by an NCAA selection committee. The selection process and tournament seedings are based on several factors, including team rankings, win loss records, and NET data.Main article: NCAA basketball tournament selection process
Since 2022, 68 teams qualify for the tournament played in March and April. Of these teams, 32 earn automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. Since 2017 the Ivy League conducts its own post-season tournament. The remaining teams are granted "at-large" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Dr. Marilyn McNeil, vice president/director of athletics at Monmouth University is the current chairwoman. On March 1, 2011, Bowling Green State University's director of intercollegiate athletics, Greg Christopher, was appointed chair of the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Committee during the 2011 12 academic year.[3]
The tournament begins with four opening-round games known as the First Four. Like the men's version, the women's First Four involves the four lowest-ranked conference champions playing for 16 seeds in the round of 64, and the four lowest-ranked at-large teams playing for their own spots in the round of 64.[4]
The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible.[citation needed] The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning that all first-round games involve teams whose seeds add up to 17).
Number of teams, and seeding[edit]
The first NCAA women's basketball tournament was held in 1982. The AIAW also held a basketball tournament in 1982, but most of the top teams, including defending AIAW champion Louisiana Tech, decided to participate in the NCAA tournament.
The championship consisted of 32 teams from 1982 to 1985 (in 1983, 36), 40 teams from 1986 to 1988, and 48 teams from 1989 to 1993. From 1994 to 2021, 64 teams competed in each tournament. From 2022, the tournament will involve 68 teams, matching the size of the D-I men's tournament.
Prior to 1996, seeding was conducted on a regional basis. The top teams (eight in the 32-, 40-, and 48-team formats, and 16 in the 64-team format) were ranked and seeded on a national basis. The remaining teams were then seeded based on their geographic region. Teams were moved outside of its geographic region only if it was necessary to balance the bracket, or if the proximity of an opponent outside of its region would be comparable and a more competitive game would result. In 1993, all teams except for the top four were explicitly unseeded. The regional seeding resumed in 1994. In 1996, seeds were assigned on a national basis using an "S-Curve" format[clarification needed] similar to the process used in selecting the field for the men's tournament.
The following table summarizes some of the key attributes of the seeding process:[5]

Selection process[edit]
Further information: NCAA basketball tournament selection process
A special selection committee appointed by the NCAA determines which 68 teams will enter the tournament, and where they will be seeded and placed in the bracket. Because of the automatic bids, only 36 teams (the at-large bids) rely on the selection committee to secure them a spot in the tournament.

^ The Big East Conference operated in its original form from 1979 until 2013. During that time, UConn won eight championships, and Notre Dame won one. Following the three-way 2013 split of that conference and subsequent settlement between the non-FBS schools and the remaining schools, the conference legally changed its name to the American Athletic Conference. Three schools (among them Notre Dame) left for the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2013, with a fourth doing the same in 2014; one school left for the Big Ten in 2014; and the non-FBS schools retained the Big East name. However, the current Big East now maintains the history of the original conference in all sports that it sponsors, including women's basketball. The American no longer claims any of the original Big East's competitive history, though legally it does even in the two sports that it sponsors and the current Big East does not (football and women's rowing).
^ Known as the Pacific-10 Conference, or Pac-10, when its first 4 titles were won.

Champions excluded the next year[edit]
Only once has the reigning champion (the previous year's winner) not made it to the tournament the next year.
1985 champion Old Dominion went 15 13 in 1986.
No. 1 seeds[edit]
Since 1982, at least one #1 seed has made the Final Four every year.
Under coach Geno Auriemma, Connecticut has been seeded #1 a record 22 times. Tennessee is second with 21 #1 seeds.
All four #1 seeds have made it to the Final Four 4 times (champion in bold):
1989 Auburn, Louisiana Tech, Maryland, Tennessee
2012 Baylor, UConn, Notre Dame, Stanford
2015 UConn, Maryland, Notre Dame, South Carolina
2018 UConn, Mississippi State, Notre Dame, Louisville
The championship game has matched two #1 seeds 14 times:
1983 USC beat Louisiana Tech
1986 Texas beat USC
1989 Tennessee beat Auburn
1991 Tennessee beat Virginia
1995 UConn beat Tennessee
2000 UConn beat Tennessee
2002 UConn beat Oklahoma
2003 UConn beat Tennessee
2010 UConn beat Stanford
2012 Baylor beat Notre Dame
2014 UConn beat Notre Dame
2015 UConn beat Notre Dame
2018 Notre Dame beat Mississippi State
2019 Baylor beat Notre Dame
Three teams have beaten three #1 seeds during the course of a tournament (the largest number of such teams that can be faced) (all three teams won the national championship as beating a 3rd #1 seed in a single tournament can only happen in the finals):
1987 Tennessee (beat Auburn, Long Beach State, Louisiana Tech)
1988 Louisiana Tech (beat Auburn, Tennessee, Texas)
2005 Baylor (beat LSU, Michigan State, North Carolina)
Prior to the expansion of the tournament to 64 teams, all four #1 seeds advanced to the Sweet Sixteen with three exceptions.  Notably, the first two times this occurred were at the hands of the same school:
1986 East #1 seed Virginia lost to #8 seed James Madison
1991 East #1 seed Penn State lost to #8 seed James Madison
1992 Midwest #1 seed Iowa lost to #8 seed Southwest Missouri State
High seeds[edit]
1999 was the first time in tournament history (since the expansion to 64 teams) that all top seeds (1, 2, 3, and 4 seeds) made it to the Sweet Sixteen.
Low seeds[edit]

Teams entering the tournament unbeaten[edit]
Of the 19 teams who have entered the tournament unbeaten, 9 went on to win the National Championship.[8]
One exception is Cal Baptist, who was excluded from the 2021 tournament as a transitional Division I member, despite a 24 0 record.
In 1986, Texas entered the tournament 30 0, beat USC for the national title, and ended the season 34 0.
In 1990, Louisiana Tech entered the tournament 29 0, but lost in the Final Four to Auburn.
In 1992, Vermont entered the tournament 29 0, but lost in the first round to George Washington.
In 1993, Vermont entered the tournament 28 0, but lost in the first round to Rutgers.
In 1995, UConn entered the tournament 29 0, beat Tennessee for the national title, and ended the season 35 0.
In 1997, UConn entered the tournament 30 0, but lost in the Midwest Regional Final to Tennessee.
In 1998, Tennessee (33 0) and Liberty (28 0) both entered the tournament unbeaten; Liberty lost in the first round to Tennessee, which went on to beat Louisiana Tech for the national title and ended the season 39 0.
In 2002, 2009, and 2010, UConn entered the tournament 33 0, won the national title in each, and ended those seasons 39 0. They respectively beat Oklahoma, Louisville, and Stanford in those championship games.
In 2012, Baylor entered the tournament 34 0, beat Notre Dame for the national title, and ended the season 40 0. The Lady Bears became the first team in NCAA college basketball history, for either women or men, to win 40 games in a season. Notably, Louisiana Tech went 40 5 during the 1979 80 season. This was during the AIAW era for women's basketball.
In 2014, UConn (34 0) and Notre Dame (32 0) both entered the tournament unbeaten; UConn beat Notre Dame 79 58 for the national title, ended the season 40 0 and is the 8th team to end the season unbeaten.
In 2015, Princeton entered the tournament 30 0, but lost in the second round to Maryland.
In 2016, UConn entered the tournament 32 0, beat Syracuse for the national title, ending the season 38 0.
In 2017, UConn entered the tournament 32 0, but lost in the Final Four to Mississippi State, ending their 111-game winning streak to finish 36 1.
In 2018, UConn entered the tournament 32 0, but lost in the Final Four to Notre Dame, ending their 36-game winning streak to finish 36 1.
In 2023, South Carolina entered the tournament 32-0, but lost in the Final Four to Iowa, ending their 42-game winning streak to finish 36-1.
Undefeated teams not in the tournament[edit]
The NCAA tournament has undergone dramatic expansion since its first edition in 1982, and only one unbeaten team has failed to qualify for the tournament California Baptist in 2021, which was 24 0 after winning the Western Athletic Conference Tournament.[9] As, by definition, a team would have to win its conference tournament, and thus secure an automatic bid to the tournament, to be undefeated in a season, the only way a team could finish undefeated and not reach the tournament is if the team is banned from postseason play. (Other possibilities are that the team is independent, or is from a conference not yet eligible for an automatic bid.) Postseason bans can come about for one of two reasons:
The team is serving a postseason ban due to NCAA sanctions.
The team is transitioning from a lower NCAA division, during which time it is barred by NCAA rule from participation in NCAA-sponsored postseason play. This is the case for California Baptist, which began a transition from Division II in 2018 and thus cannot play in the NCAA tournament until 2023.
California Baptist was eligible for the WNIT because that tournament is not operated by the NCAA, unlike the men's version; the Lancers lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Rice.
Home state[edit]
Only one team has ever played the Final Four on its home court. Two other teams have played the Final Four in their home cities, and seven others have played the Final Four in their home states.
The only team to play on its home court was Texas in 1987, which lost its semifinal game at the Frank Erwin Special Events Center.
Old Dominion enjoyed nearly as large an advantage in 1983 when the Final Four was played at the Norfolk Scope in its home city of Norfolk, Virginia, but also lost its semifinal. The Scope has never been the Lady Monarchs' regular home court. ODU has always used on-campus arenas, first the ODU Fieldhouse and since 2002 Chartway Arena.  The following year, USC won the national title at Pauley Pavilion, the home court of its Los Angeles arch-rival UCLA.
Of the other teams to play in their home states, Stanford (1992) won the national title; Notre Dame (2011) lost in the championship game; and Western Kentucky (1986), Penn State (2000), Missouri State (2001), LSU (2004), and Baylor (2010) lost in the semifinals.

Television coverage and revenues[edit]
Main article: List of NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament Final Four broadcasters
Broadcast rights to the NCAA women's basketball tournament are included in a larger package covering the majority of Division I national championships outside of men's basketball (which is held by CBS Sports and Turner Sports),[12] and golf (which is held by Golf Channel).[13] ESPN has held exclusive rights to the tournament since 1996; beginning with an 11-year, $200 million contract renewal in 2003, ESPN would televise all 63 games in the tournament on television (increasing from 23), with games in the first and second rounds airing regionally on ESPN and ESPN2. Out-of-market games were carried via pay-per-view.[14] Coverage later expanded to include ESPN's college sports-oriented network ESPNU, and ESPN360 for streaming.[15]  In 2011, ESPN renewed this agreement through the 2023 24 season, in a deal reported to be worth $500 million in total. The deal also included rights to the men's tournament outside of the United States for ESPN International.[16]
In the first two rounds, one channel (typically ESPN or ESPN2's high definition feed) typically aired "whiparound" coverage during each window, carrying rolling coverage of all games in progress. ESPN's standard definition channels were used to broadcast games on a regional basis, while games could also be viewed in their entirety on ESPN3 or alternate channels.[15] In 2021, ESPN adopted a broadcast arrangement similar to the men's tournament, with all games airing nationally in their entirety on either an ESPN linear channel or, for the first time, ABC. The Women's Final Four and championship remained exclusive to ESPN.[17] In 2023, the national championship game aired on ABC for the first time.[18]
In data issued by the NCAA in 2021, it was stated that 15.9% of the value of the contract was allocated to the women's tournament, or approximately $6.1 million annually. In comparison, the contract for the men's tournament is valued at over $700 million annually. Amid scrutiny of inequality between the men's and women's tournaments that year, it has been suggested by critics that the structure of the NCAA's contract undervalues the media rights to the women's tournament.[19][20] Based on average viewership, Emily Caron and Eben Novy-Williams of Sportico estimated that the women's tournament could fetch at least $20 million per-year if its media rights were sold separately. America East Conference commissioner Amy Huchthausen argued that the ESPN contract "provides a measure of financial certainty, but it does not provide women's basketball (or any of the other sports, for that matter) an incentive to grow".[21]
Following major media criticism of inequities between the 2021 men's and women's tournaments, the NCAA commissioned a comprehensive gender equity review of its championships by the law firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink. Among the report's findings was that U.S. television rights for the women's tournament would be worth at least $81 million annually by the time the current broadcast contract with ESPN expires in 2024. The current contract, which includes rights not only to the women's tournament but also 28 other NCAA championship events, provides the NCAA an average of $34 million over the life of the contract.[22][23]
In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on the day of the 2023 national championship, new NCAA president Charlie Baker implicated that the media rights to the women's basketball tournament may be sold separately in the next rights cycle, stating that "we do have an opportunity to put it out separately, and we're going to work really hard to make sure that those student-athletes, those schools, those programs get what I describe as what they should get."[24] Interest in Caitlin Clark's tournament run had led to record viewership of Iowa's Women's Final Four and championship games, which both set records for ESPN/ABC.[18][25]
