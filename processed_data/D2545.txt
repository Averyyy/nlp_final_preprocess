History[edit]
The airport began as a Royal Air Force airfield in 1944 during the Second World War, RAF Negombo with No. 45 Squadron RAF (1946 49),[3] No. 232 Squadron RAF (1945),[4] No. 249 Squadron RAF (1950)[5] and No. 1303 Flight RAF (1945 46).[6] In 1957, Prime minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike removed all the British Military airfields from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and the airfield was handed over to the Royal Ceylon Air Force (RCyAF) and renamed Katunayake; part of it still remains a military airfield. In 1964 Anil Moonesinghe, the Minister of Communications, started the building of a new international airport to replace Ratmalana, with Canadian aid. The airport was completed in 1967, and Air Ceylon, the national carrier, began international operations from it using a Hawker Siddeley Trident and a leased British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) VC-10. It was named after former Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike, in 1970. It was renamed Katunayake International Airport in 1977, but was changed back to Bandaranaike International Airport in 1995.[7]
On 7 November 1971, the first Boeing 747 landed at the airport. The Boeing 747-200B was operated by Condor carrying German tourists from Frankfurt. In the early 1990s the position of the airport's runway (04/22) was shifted northward and the old runway was made into a taxiway for departing and arriving aircraft. Airport expansion projects have recently been undertaken at the airport under the Stage 1, Phase II Expansion Project. A pier with eight aero-bridges opened in November 2005. A new terminal with an additional eight gates are proposed to be built under Stage II of the Phase II Expansion Project. Construction of the new Stage II, Phase II Expansion Project is expected to commence in April 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2020.[citation needed]
On 7 May 2007, the Sri Lankan Government shifted military aviation operations out of the space adjoining the airport to SLAF Hingurakgoda, thus paving the way for the expansion of civilian operations. As part of the airport development program, a passenger train service was launched between the Airport and Colombo Secretariat Station, in June 2010.[8] The airport is used by Emirates as an alternative emergency airport for its Airbus A380 aircraft.[8][9] On 9 January 2012, an Airbus A380-800 operated by Emirates landed at Bandaranaike International Airport. This was the first time in history that an Airbus A380 had landed in a Sri Lankan airport.[10]
SriLankan Airlines is the largest airline operating at the airport, with a fleet of 27 Airbus aircraft.[11]
In the past, British Airways, KLM, Kuwait Airways, LTU International, Royal Jordanian Airlines, Saudia and Swissair are the airlines that previously served Colombo for many years.[citation needed]
Facilities[edit]
Terminals[edit]
Bandaranaike International Airport (airport code CMB[12]) at Katunayake, Sri Lanka, is 32.5 kilometers north of the island nation's capital of Colombo. Thirty seven(37) airlines currently serve the airport's over 10.79 million annual passengers.[13] The airport has three passenger terminals. Terminal 1 is the current international terminal, built in 1967. Terminal 2 is the new international terminal, which is expected to be completed in 2019. Terminal 3 is the new domestic terminal, which opened in November 2012.
Terminal 1 opened in 1967 and is the oldest and largest terminal in the airport. It has 12 gates. The arrival and departure areas are separated horizontally. All international flights currently use this terminal, until Terminal 2 opens in 2019. The terminal consists of a main terminal building directly connected to one concourse which houses all the gates. Once past security, passengers proceed through the long, arm-shaped concourse housing gates 6 14. On the upper level of this concourse, there are two lounges. In the main body of the terminal is SriLankan Airlines' "Serendib Lounge", and the Palm Spirit lounge. This area has duty-free shops, a tea shop, a cafeteria, a smoking lounge, and day-rooms & showers.
Terminal 2 is planned to open in 2019. It is planned to have 8 gates, with arrival and departure areas separated vertically. A new terminal with eight more gates is proposed to be built under Stage II of the Phase II Expansion Project. Construction of the new Stage II, Phase II Expansion Project was commenced in April 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2019. A new pier with eight boarding gates and 14 passenger boarding bridges, with an additional gate comprising two passenger boarding bridges for the Airbus A380, will be included in the proposed new development.
Terminal 3 opened in November 2012 and handles all domestic flights. Its arrival and departure areas are separated horizontally.[14]
The Cargo Terminal opened in October 2009 and handles all cargo flights. Its arrival and departure areas are separated horizontally.
Aprons[edit]
Apron Alpha: It is the oldest existing apron at the airport. It has 9 parking bays including 5 remote parking bays and 4 boarding bridge equipped bays. It can handle 4 Boeing 747 aircraft and 5 Airbus A330-200 aircraft at once.
Apron Bravo: It has 8 parking bays, including 4 remote parking bays and 4 boarding bridge equipped bays. It can handle any 8 wide-body such as an Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Boeing 777 or Boeing 747 at once. The 4 remote bays will be converted into 4 Airbus A380 capable boarding bridges under the Stage II development project.
Apron Charlie: It has 8 parking bays, all of them are currently remote bays. It can handle any 8 wide-body such as an Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Boeing 777 or Boeing 747 at once. The remote bays will be converted into 8 Airbus A380 capable boarding bridges under the Stage II development project. It is the only apron that is currently capable of handling the Airbus A380-800. It has been used by Emirates Airbus A380s thrice.
Apron Delta: It has 4 parking bays capable of handling narrow-body aircraft.
Apron Echo: Newest apron of the airport, that has 17 parking bays. Opened on 25th November 2021.[citation needed]
Runway[edit]
The Bandaranaike International Airport has a single runway (04/22), with an asphalt surface. The take-off and landing distances are 3,441 m and 3,350 m respectively.[15] In addition, Phase II of the BIA expansion project is to have a second runway, also able to accommodate the A380, with another taxiway to the second runway.
Available frequencies[edit]
Bandaranaike International Airport Approach - 132.4Mhz
Bandaranaike International Airport Tower    - 118.7Mhz
Expansion projects[edit]
The airport is undergoing resurfacing of its runway. Future projects include a second runway to support the Airbus A380, a further eight passenger gates, a domestic terminal, a five-storey car-park, and a five-star hotel neighbouring the airport. Construction of the new approach channels to the airport will begin in April 2017.[16]
A new split-level passenger terminal building, which separates arrivals and departures vertically, a new pier with eight boarding gates, and fourteen passenger boarding bridges, with a dedicated gate comprising two passenger boarding bridges for the new Airbus A380, will be included in the proposed new complex. There would also be a remote apron and an additional nine parking stands to ease air traffic movement. There would be a tax-free apparel shopping mall at the Katunayake BOI Zone to attract more business visitors to Sri Lanka. The mall is to be adjacent to the arrival terminal and connected by a sky bridge.
The second stage will involve the acquisition of 600 ha (1,500 acres) of public land, the construction of a runway capable of accommodating new-generation airplanes, an aircraft repair and maintenance center, an arrival and a departure terminal, a shopping arcade, a cargo complex connected to the airport by rail and a multi-storey car park. Under the Development Project Phase II, Stage 2, a second passenger terminal and a required utility for second terminal will be constructed. Work will also be carried out to expand the terminal, aircraft parking apron, and public utilities. The existing airport terminal will be converted to a domestic and regional terminal, when the new complex is ready. A two tier passenger terminal with arrivals and departures physically separated as found in most modern airports will also be constructed. A rapid exit to the Colombo   Katunayake Highway will be provided directly from the terminal. 
The project has been divided into two packages and the bidding has been completed for both packages.
The construction work of Package B  "Remote Apron and Taxiways" commenced in April 2017.
The bids for Package A- "Terminal building and associated works" are under evaluation. Construction is expected to commence by November 2017 with the selection of the main contractor.

SLAF Katunayake[edit]
In 1956 with the departure of the RAF from RAF Negombo, the Royal Ceylon Air Force took over and renamed the station RCyAF Katunayake. With the construction of the Bandaranaike International Airport, major portion of the air base was taken over. However the Sri Lanka Air Force remained and expanded its air base adjoining the International Airport. At present it is the largest SLAF station in the country and is the airfield for several flying squadrons as well as ground units. The Air Force Hospital is also based at SLAF Katunayake.[36]
In March 2001, on the 50th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Air Force, the airfield was presented with the President's Colours.[37]
