Series of vaccinations

 Example Polish call for vaccination against Diphtheria and Tetanus.
 Global vaccination coverage 1980 to 2019 among one year olds[1]
A vaccination schedule is a series of vaccinations, including the timing of all doses, which may be either recommended or compulsory, depending on the country of residence.
A vaccine is an antigenic preparation used to produce active immunity to a disease, in order to prevent or reduce the effects of infection by any natural or "wild" pathogen.[2]
Many vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness, either to produce sufficient initial immune response or to boost response that fades over time. For example, tetanus vaccine boosters are often recommended every 10 years.[3] Vaccine schedules are developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended vaccines for a locality while minimizing the number of health care system interactions. Over the past two decades, the recommended vaccination schedule has grown rapidly and become more complicated as many new vaccines have been developed.[4]
Some vaccines are recommended only in certain areas (countries, sub national areas, or at-risk populations) where a disease is common. For instance, yellow fever vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana, is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United States is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the disease.[5] In developing countries, vaccine recommendations also take into account the level of health care access, the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage. Sample vaccination schedules discussed by the World Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a child's life and uses vaccines which cost over $700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only $25.[6] This difference is due to the lower cost of health care, the lower cost of many vaccines provided to developing nations, and that more expensive vaccines, often for less common diseases, are not utilized.
Worldwide[edit]
The World Health Organization monitors vaccination schedules across the world, noting what vaccines are included in each country's program, the coverage rates achieved and various auditing measures.[7] The table below shows the types of vaccines given in example countries. The WHO publishes on its website current vaccination schedules for all WHO member states.[8] Additional vaccines are given to individuals more likely to come into contact with specific diseases through work or travel (e.g. military), or after potentially infectious exposure. Examples include rabies, anthrax, cholera and smallpox.[9][10]

^ Recommended but not free of charge for those over 65 years.
^ Vaccination can be given from 6 months of age in case of travel abroad. If vaccination starts before 12 months of age, 2 doses are recommended (14 18 months and 6 years) The temporary recommendation of giving measles at 12 months of age was made a permanent recommendation; ie. now MMR should be given from 12 18 months except if travelling abroad to measles infected countries when it can be given from 6 months on. In case MMR is given at 6 11 months, the child needs a second and third dose to complete the series.
^ Varicella vaccination implemented from 1 September 2017. Catch-up to all those born on 1 January 2006 or after and with no history of varicella.

  General Recommendation  # Recommended for specific groups only.   Catch-up
Japan[edit]
The vaccination schedule in Japan is defined and partially recommended by Immunization Act [ja] (Japanese:  ) and its related cabinet order [ja] (Japanese:  ).[14][15] By the combined laws, infections are categorized into two groups: Category A is recommended for vaccination to prevent pandemic whereas Category B is only for a personal care purpose.[31] As of January 2020, fourteen infections are Category A diseases and two are Category B on the legal lists.[14][15] The Act and the Order were enacted for mandatory vaccination in 1948 with punitive clauses, only the clauses were repealed in 1976 and eventually vaccination has become non-mandatory since 1994.[32]

^ a b Vaccines for measles and rubella (MR vaccine) can be received anytime from 5 y/o before 7 y/o, AND the time should be also between one year and one day before the first day of schooling (quote: " ".
^ a b HPV for female students only. Vaccination can be started from the first day of school year within she turns 12, and until the last day of school year within she turns 16 (quote: " ").
^ Age 60 64 with certain diseases: heart, kidney or respitory failures, or with an immune-related disorder due to HIV infection.
Only in the legal term in Japan, citizens get old one day before their birthdays. If a person was born on January 1, 2020, and Immunization Act specifies vaccine against measles could be received from age 12 months to 24 months, vaccination shall be practiced between December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021 (not between January 2021 and January 2022.)[33][34] Some vaccinations are scheduled in line with the school year system, which starts from April 1 in Japan.[35] As explained, those who born on April 1 and on April 2 get old legally on March 31 and April 1, respectively. Thus, these two people are in different school years and thereby they may take vaccines in different calendar years.

Non-routine vaccinations[edit]
Some children may receive vaccines in addition to those listed in the table:
BCG vaccine is given at birth to "children born in areas of the country where there are high numbers of TB cases" and "children whose parents or grandparents were born in a country with many cases of TB."[39]
Hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth to "babies born to mothers who have hepatitis B".[39]
The injected flu vaccine is offered annually to "children 6 months to 17 years old with long-term health conditions".[39]
Adult vaccinations[edit]
The five scheduled childhood tetanus vaccinations are thought to generally confer lifelong immunity; thus, no routine booster doses are given in adulthood. Those adults at risk of contaminated cuts (e.g., gardeners) may have booster tetanus vaccination every ten years.[40] Pneumococcus vaccinations (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine/PPV) are recommended for those over 65 and for people without a functional spleen (asplenia), either because the spleen has been removed or does not work properly.[41] Flu vaccine is recommended for anyone who is aged 65 years and over, people with certain long-term medical conditions, health and social care professionals, pregnant women, and poultry workers.[42] The shingles vaccine is recommended for those over 70.[39] Additionally, pregnant women are advised to have the pertussis vaccine.[43]
United States[edit]
The most up-to-date schedules are available from CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. In the US, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires all health-care providers to provide parents or patients with copies of Vaccine Information Statements before administering vaccines.[44]

  Range of recommended ages for everyone. See references for more details. # Range of recommended ages for certain high-risk groups. See references for more details.  Range of recommended ages for catch-up immunization or for people who lack evidence of immunity (e.g., lack documentation of vaccination or have no evidence of prior infection).[a]  Recommended vaccination based on sharedclinical decision-making.
^ CDC provides more detailed information in catch-up immunizations.
During pregnancy[edit]
The CDC recommends pregnant women receive some vaccines, such as the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine a month or more before pregnancy. The Tdap vaccine (to help protect against whooping cough) is recommended during pregnancy. Other vaccines, like the flu shot, can be given before or during pregnancy, depending on whether or not it is flu season. Vaccination is safe right after giving birth, even while breastfeeding.[47][48][49][50]
History[edit]
In 1900, the smallpox vaccine was the only one administered to children. By the early 1950s, children routinely received three vaccines, for protection against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and smallpox, and as many as five shots by two years of age.[4] Since the mid-1980s, many vaccines have been added to the schedule. In 2009, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended vaccination against at least fourteen diseases. By two years of age, U.S. children receive as many as 24 vaccine injections, and might receive up to five shots during one visit to the doctor.[4] The use of combination vaccine products means that, as of 2013[update], the United Kingdom's immunization program consists of nine injections by the age of two, rather than 22 if vaccination for each disease was given as a separate injection.[51]
