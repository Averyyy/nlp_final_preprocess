Everybody Hates Chris is an American television semi-autobiographical sitcom that is inspired by the memories of the teenage years of comedian Chris Rock. The show is set from 1982 to 1987, although Rock himself was actually a teenager from 1978 to 1984, having been born in the year 1965.[1][2][3][4][5]
The show was created by Rock and Ali LeRoi,[6] and was originally developed for Fox, before being passed over.[7] It was then picked-up by UPN where it aired for its first season in 2005. UPN merged with The WB to become the CW a year later, where it aired its remaining three seasons. In 2009, Rock announced that the series' end had matched up with his own past and he felt it was time to end the show.[8][9][10]
Characters[edit]
Main article: List of Everybody Hates Chris characters
Tyler James Williams as Chris, a skinny, nerdy, African-American teenager   portraying Chris Rock in his younger years.[2][4][11]
Terry Crews as Julius   Chris' caring, hard-working, penny-pinching father.[2][11]
Tichina Arnold as Rochelle   Chris' loving, conscientious, demanding, temperamental, disciplinarian mother.[2][11]
Tequan Richmond as Drew   Chris' easy-going, good-looking, popular, athletic, bigger, younger brother.[2][11]
Imani Hakim as Tonya   Chris' little sister, spoiled by her father, and often spiteful to Chris.[2][11]
Vincent Martella as Greg Wuliger   Chris' small, nerdy white schoolmate and best friend.[4][11]
Synopsis[edit]
The show is a family sitcom, patterned on Chris Rock's recollection of his teenage years growing up in the 1980s with a wholesome, tight-knit, African-American family, while living in drug-and-gang infested Bedford Stuyvesant, a neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, and also attending a cross-town, white-dominated, public high school.[3][4][7][10][12]
The real-life Chris Rock provides intermittent narration throughout the show, at times interjecting his young self's thoughts or sometimes simply recounting the situation he's describing.
Chris' family is firmly dominated by strong, loving parents: Julius, a hard-working, frugal laborer who works two jobs while remaining carefully loyal to his wife,[2][11][12]  Rochelle, a conscientious and powerful housewife and mother who is fiercely protective of the family, while also being fiercely demanding of all in it, especially eldest son Chris.[2][11][12]
The series starts just after the parents have moved their children "out of the [low-income housing] projects," and into a more-upscale two-story apartment in Brooklyn's Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood known for its roughness as "Bed-Stuy, do-or-die."[3][12]
Chris is a skinny, nerdy young teen.[2][11] His mother decides to send him to a mostly-white school across town ("two bus rides away") in an ethnic-Italian neighborhood to ensure he gets a better education. The school is slyly named "Corleone Junior High School" (an apparent reference to the fictional Corleone mafia family from the movie The Godfather or its real-life parallel, the Corleonesi).[5][3][12]
Chris find the new school difficult to adjust to because of social ostracism and the ire of a red-haired bully named Caruso. Ms. Morello, a well-meaning white teacher, treats Chris with naive, condescending assumptions derived from crude racial/ghetto stereotypes. The bright spot in school is Chris's best friend, Greg (played by Vincent Martella) a smaller but similarly nerdy white kid.[2][4][11]
At home, Chris is often left in charge of his siblings his younger-but-bigger brother, Drew, and an ornery little sister, Tonya.[3][12] Mother Rochelle usually keeps a firm grip on the family, while their exhausted breadwinner father, Julius, struggles to catch a little sleep between jobs.[12]
Chris interacts with various characters in the neighborhood diverse personalities based on real people Rock would see as a kid in his community. These personalities include some hoodlums who try to take advantage of him, a demented old homeless man, a shrewd, miserly-but-grandfatherly storekeeper named Doc, and Doc's neurotic, paranoid, combat-veteran nephew. For several episodes, an overbearing neighbor lady is played by Whoopi Goldberg, grandmother of the pretty girl next door.
The show laced with comedy and farce is primarily about adolescence and family life in inner-city poverty, the determined struggles of good, decent parents to provide a better life and values for their family, and the challenges their children present to them, and to each other.[2][12][5]
Reception[edit]
Everybody Hates Chris received critical acclaim. The American Film Institute selected Everybody Hates Chris as one of the best 10 television series of 2007, stating that the show "provides a very real look at growing up in America   a challenge that demands a discussion of race and class often absent from television today."[13]
Before it even aired, previewers were rating it highly, with The Futon Critic calling it "UPN's best comedy to date... light years ahead of anything [UPN] has tried before... one of the genre's best [examples] in recent memory," adding that it was "Authentic for its timeframe, [while not] trying too hard" telling audiences they had "to check this one out."[12]
While comparing it to The Cosby Show, the New York Times cited its more down-to-earth scenario, and summed it up as the first teenager-centered show in years where the protagonist's "main problem is not [mere] adolescent angst, but real life", adding that Rock made the show "funny, not maudlin or mean."[5]
During the 2006 William S. Paley Television Festival (which "celebrates the excellence and diversity of American television," sponsored by the Museum of Television and Radio), the show was honored with a screening of the pilot episode and a subsequent episode ("Everybody Hates a Part-Time Job") at the Directors Guild of America Theatre Complex in Los Angeles, followed by a panel discussion with cast and crew, led by museum and media leaders.[6]
Everybody Hates Chris was named one of the Best School Shows of All Time by AOL TV.[14] Common Sense Media's Marjorie Kase and Shanel Walker & Emily Kofoed gave the show 4 stars, and said it was "a prime example of how to take serious issues and approach them in a humorous yet thought-provoking way. The series is innovative, funny, and stereotype-defying   enjoyable for teens and their parents."[15]
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the series has an approval rating of 95%.[2] The site's critics consensus for the first season states, "Aided by Chris Rock's humorous narration, Everybody Hates Chris' first season offers refreshingly honest insights into real life by addressing race, class, and adolescence."[16]
