Alvin Independent School District is a school district based in Alvin, Texas, U.S.
Alvin ISD is a large suburban school district south of Houston in Alvin, Manvel, Hillcrest, Iowa Colony, Liverpool, and portions of Pearland.[4] It also serves Amsterdam and some areas with Rosharon postal addresses. AISD serves Pearland city's rapidly growing western portion of the city including the new large master-planned communities of Shadow Creek Ranch, South Fork, and Southern Trails.  Alvin ISD covers 252 square miles (650 km2) of land.
Finances[edit]
As of the 2020/21 school year, the appraised valuation of property in the district was $10,805,729,375.[citation needed] The Maintenance tax rate was $1.0052. The I&S Rate is .3925. The tax rate was $1.3977 per $100 of appraised valuation.[citation needed]
Academic achievement[edit]
In 2011, the school district was rated "Recognized" by the Texas Education Agency.[5]  Forty-nine percent of districts in Texas in 2011 received the same rating.[6] No state accountability ratings will be given to districts in 2012.[7] A school district in Texas can receive one of four possible rankings from the Texas Education Agency: Exemplary (the highest possible ranking), Recognized, Academically Acceptable, and Academically Unacceptable (the lowest possible ranking).

District Realignment[edit]
Beginning with the 2008 2009 school year, Alvin Independent School District was realigned the following way: Sister schools (Alvin Primary School/Alvin Elementary School; Stevenson Primary School/Walt Disney Elementary School; and Mark Twain Primary School/Longfellow Elementary School) became grades PK-2 and 3 5. All other elementary schools were changed to grades PK-5 with 6th grade being transitioned to the Junior High level across the district. The two alternative schools were not affected by this realignment.
In November 2010 a School Boundary Advisory Committee began work on a new plan to realign the school zones to better balance the student populations and accommodate a new elementary school opening in August 2011 and a new junior high opening in 2012.
