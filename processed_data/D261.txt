History[edit]
Settlement[edit]
 View of NE side of Main St, frame building built in 1830 by John Miller
Northville was first settled by European Americans in 1825, and was incorporated as a Village in 1867. It was not incorporated as a City until 1955.  Originally one of two communities within Plymouth Township, Northville Township split off in 1898 to form its own township.
The first land patent in the Northville area was granted to Gideon Benton in 1823; the current Cass Benton Park is located here. The first settlers did not arrive, however, until 1825. Many of these first settlers were originally from central and western New York State, with ancestors in New England. Others came from the nearby, already settled Plymouth community to Northville.
Among these early settlers were Alanson Aldrich, followed by Alvale Smith, who sold his property to John Miller. Miller built the first mill in Plymouth Township, sometime between 1825 and 1828. Mill Race Historical Village is now preserved at this site. Many employees of the mill began to build their houses near it. Northville was named for its relation north of Plymouth.
In 1827, Northville was home to a post office, and Gideon Benton was the US postmaster. Also in 1827, J.F. Davis, became the first resident doctor in Northville. A tailor, tavern, shoe shop, and two blacksmiths also started business in the village. Many of Northville's first settlers' surnames became namesakes for contemporary street names today. These include Rufus Thayer Jr. (Thayer Blvd.), Joseph Yerkes (Yerkes St.), Daniel and Samuel Cady (Cady St.), William Dunlap (Dunlap St.), and other settlers. The first church was constructed in 1836 by a Methodist congregation.[6]
Victorian era[edit]
Northville continued to grow throughout the Victorian era. This is evident in the architecture around downtown where many homes are in the Queen Anne style. Northville's Victorian heritage is celebrated every September in the Victorian Festival, which was recently rechristened the "Heritage Festival".[7]
The first schoolhouse in Northville opened in 1853 and was taught by Jacob Ramsdell. Northville was incorporated as a village in 1867 from a portion of Plymouth Township.[6] By the end of the nineteenth century, it had established a public school system headed by a superintendent.
Village era[edit]
Henry Ford purchased a factory in Northville and moved machinery from plants in the area to the factory in 1919. Known as the Northville Valve Plant, the plant was rebuilt in 1936, and enlarged in 1956. The plant provided valves for every Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln vehicle, except for the Lincoln Continental, until closing and being sold in 1981. The building now houses offices and a health club. In 1925, the Penniman-Allen Theater opened downtown and remained open through the mid-70's. The theater eventually closed, but opened again in 1978 as the Marquis Theater and is now home to live children's theater.[8] When Northville was more rural, skiing was popular and tournaments were held often. In 1944, Northville Downs opened as the first nighttime harness racing track in Michigan. The Downs were built on the site of the former Wayne County Fair, where Joe Louis trained in 1939 for his World Championship later that year. Northville Downs has been in continuous operation since 1944, and is located at the corner of Center Street and 7 Mile Road.[6]
City era[edit]
 Downtown Northville
The city was incorporated in 1955 along the boundaries of the Village of Northville, and grew rapidly during the prolonged period of white flight from the City of Detroit in the middle and late 20th century. The Village of Northville included portions of Novi Township in Oakland County and Northville Township in Wayne County. Over the next several years, the city boundaries expanded through annexation of portions of Novi Township and the Village of Novi both east and west of the city and north of Baseline Road. The city's northern boundary was fixed by the incorporation of the Village of Novi into the City of Novi in 1969. The city has also annexed small portions of Northville Township, the most recent of which was an expansion of the Rural Hill Cemetery. Northville Township's status as a Charter Township generally precludes the City from annexing any significant portion of the Township. The most recent annexation was permitted by the Township in order for the city to expand the city-owned and operated cemetery.
Libraries[edit]
In 1889, the Ladies Library Association was organized by Mary Lapham, and had 1,200 books and 150 members by 1892. The library was located in the former Young Men's Hall until 1964, when it moved temporarily to the new City Hall .[6] In 1975, the library moved again temporarily to the Northville Square Mall; in 1980 it returned to City Hall. In 1996, it moved into the newly built Northville District Library.[6]
Geography[edit]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.06 square miles (5.34 km2), of which 2.04 square miles (5.28 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) (0.97%) is water.
The city is divided almost equally between Oakland County to the north and Wayne County to the south.  Eight Mile Road (or Baseline Road) serves as the county line.  Of the city's 2.06 square miles (5.34 km2) in area and population of 5,970, 1.06 square miles (2.75 km2) (51.4%) and 2,739 residences (45.9%) are within Wayne County.  Oakland County contains 1.00 square mile (2.59 km2) of land  (48.6%) and 3,231 residents (54.1%).[9]
Mill Race Village[edit]
In 1972, the historic Mill Race Village was opened on the site of John Miller's gristmill, made possible by a donation from Ford Motor Company. Historic buildings were colocated here to represent a typical gathering of early buildings and uses. Located on Griswold Avenue, the complex includes the following:
The New School Church, formerly used as the Northville District Library, which is still operating as a church[6]
Wash Oak School, built in 1873 and moved to the village in 1975[6]
Hunter House, a Greek Revival architecture house built in 1849[6]
Yerkes House, a Victorian architecture house built in 1868 for the wealthy William Yerkes[6]
A Victorian-style gazebo built in 1979 by Northville High School students[6]
Cottage House, built in 1890s and now used as the base of a weavers' guild[6]
Hirsch Blacksmith Shop, a replica built in 1985. The building is occupied by the village's store[6]

An additional two classrooms and a connecting structure to the worship facility were added in 1985.[22] The current 19 classroom facility opened in 2006.

The Northville and Plymouth parishes split in 1922. A $226,000 church facility opened in the fall of 1956. In 1961 an addition worth $35,000 was put in the convent. Another rectory was installed in the period from 1967 through 1968.[22] There is also a Methodist Church, two Presbyterian Churches, and many more.[24]
