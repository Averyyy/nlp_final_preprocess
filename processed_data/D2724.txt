Jamie Lee Curtis (born November 22, 1958) is an American actress, producer, and children's author. Known for her performances in the horror and slasher genres, she is regarded as a scream queen, in addition to roles in comedies.[1] Curtis has received multiple accolades, including an Academy Award, a BAFTA, and two Golden Globes, as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy and a Grammy.
The youngest daughter of actors Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, she made her television debut in a 1977 episode of the NBC drama series Quincy, M.E.. Curtis made her film debut and rose to prominence with her portrayal of Laurie Strode in John Carpenter's slasher film Halloween (1978). A critical and commercial success, the film established Curtis as a scream queen and led to starring roles in the horror films The Fog, Prom Night, Terror Train (all 1980), and Roadgames (1981). She reprised the role of Strode in several Halloween sequels, until 2022.[2]
Curtis's film work spans many genres outside of horror, including the comedies Trading Places (1983), for which she won the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress, and A Fish Called Wanda (1988), for which she received a nomination for the BAFTA for Best Actress.[3] Her role as a workout instructor in the film Perfect (1985) earned her a reputation as a sex symbol.[4] She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Helen Tasker in James Cameron's True Lies (1994).[5] Her other notable film credits include Freaky Friday (2003), Knives Out (2019), and Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022). Her performance in the latter earned Curtis multiple accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[6][7][8] As of 2023, her films have grossed over $2.5 billion at the box office.[9]
Curtis received another Golden Globe for her portrayal of Hannah Miller on ABC's sitcom Anything but Love (1989 1992), and earned a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for the television film Nicholas' Gift (1998).[10] She also starred in the Fox series Scream Queens (2015 2016), for which she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination.[5] Curtis has written numerous children's books, including Today I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day (1998), which made The New York Times's best-seller list. She is married to British-American filmmaker Christopher Guest, with whom she has two adopted children.
Early life
 Curtis as a baby with her mother in 1960
Jamie Lee Curtis was born in Santa Monica, California, on November 22, 1958, the daughter of actors Janet Leigh (born Jeanette Helen Morrison; 1927 2004) and Tony Curtis (born Bernard Schwartz; 1925 2010). Her mother was of Danish, German, and Scotch-Irish descent.[11] Her father was Jewish, a son of emigrants from M t szalka, Hungary.[12] She has an older sister, actress Kelly Curtis (born 1956), and four half-siblings from her father's later marriages: Alexandra, actress Allegra Curtis (born 1966), Benjamin, and Nicholas (who died of a drug overdose in 1994).[13]
Curtis's parents divorced in 1962. She has stated that, after the divorce, her father was "not around" and that he was "not interested in being a father".[14] After her father's death, she learned that she and her siblings had all been cut out of his will.[15] Her mother married stockbroker Robert Brandt, who helped raise her.[16] Curtis attended the elite Harvard-Westlake School and Beverly Hills High School in Los Angeles, and graduated in 1976 from Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Connecticut.[17] Returning to California in 1976, she studied law at her mother's alma mater University of the Pacific in Stockton, California[18][19] but dropped out after one semester to pursue an acting career.[20]
Career
1977-1979: Television debut and Halloween
Curtis made her television debut in a 1977 episode of the drama series Quincy, M.E.. She went on to guest star on several series, including Columbo, Charlie's Angels and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. She appeared as Nurse Lt. Barbara Duran in the short-lived comedy series Operation Petticoat (1977 1978), based on the 1959 film that starred her father, Tony Curtis. Curtis was also a game show panelist on several episodes of Match Game.
Her film debut occurred in John Carpenter's 1978 horror film Halloween, in which she played the role of Laurie Strode. The film was a major success and was considered the highest-grossing independent film of its time, earning accolades as a classic horror film. The producer, Debra Hill, specifically cast Curtis because her mother, Janet Leigh, had been known as a horror icon due to her Oscar-nominated performance in Psycho.[21] Curtis was subsequently cast in several horror films, garnering her a reputation as a scream queen.[1] She would also return to the Halloween franchise seven times, playing Strode in the sequels Halloween II (1981), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), Halloween: Resurrection (2002), Halloween (2018), Halloween Kills (2021), and Halloween Ends (2022), and having an uncredited voice role in Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982).
1980-1982: Scream Queen
Her next film following Halloween was The Fog, which was also helmed by Carpenter and produced by Hill. The film opened in February 1980 to mixed reviews but strong box office,[22] starting Curtis as a horror film starlet. In the years since its release, the film has achieved critical reappraisal and developed a cult following.[23] Her next film, Prom Night, was a low-budget Canadian slasher film released in July 1980. The film, for which she earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress, was similar in style to Halloween, yet received negative reviews which marked it as a disposable entry in the then-popular slasher genre. That year, Curtis also starred in Terror Train, which opened in October and met with negative reviews akin to Prom Night. Both films performed moderately well at the box office.[9] Curtis's roles in the latter two films served a similar function to that of Strode the main character whose friends are murdered and is practically the only protagonist to survive. Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave negative reviews to all three of Curtis's 1980 films, said that Curtis "is to the current horror film glut what Christopher Lee was to the last one or Boris Karloff was in the 1930s."[24]
In 1981, she appeared alongside Stacey Keach in the Australian thriller film Roadgames, directed by Carpenter's friend Richard Franklin; her importation, which was requested by the film's American distributor AVCO Embassy Pictures, was contested by the Sydney branch of Actors Equity.[25][26] Although the film was a box office bomb in Australia and Franklin later regretted not increasing the size of Curtis's role, it has achieved a cult following and was championed by Quentin Tarantino.[27] That same year, Curtis reprised her role of Laurie Strode in Halloween II and starred in the television film Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story, playing the eponymous doomed Playmate.
1983-1989: Trading Places and established actress
 Curtis at the 1989 Primetime Emmy Awards
Her role as a kindhearted prostitute in 1983's Trading Places helped Curtis shed her horror queen image; the film was a great critical and commercial success and garnered Curtis a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.[3] She had previously worked with director John Landis on the documentary Coming Soon. The studio originally objected to Curtis's casting, as she was primarily associated with horror films: "The casting people all thought [Landis] was crazy, and he single-handedly changed the course of my life by giving me that part", Curtis later stated.[28] The following year, Curtis appeared in the romantic drama film Love Letters and the comedy-drama Grandview, U.S.A..
In 1985, Curtis was cast opposite John Travolta as a workout instructor in the film Perfect. While her role earned her a reputation as a sex symbol,[4] the film was a critical and commercial flop. It has since earned a cult following, and in a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Quentin Tarantino called the movie "greatly underappreciated."[29] The following year, she starred in the HBO film As Summers Die. She then starred in the 1988 comedy film A Fish Called Wanda, which achieved cult status while showcasing her as a comedic actress. For her performance, she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role[3] and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress   Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.[5] That same year, Curtis starred in the film Dominick and Eugene alongside Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta.
Her first starring role on television came opposite Richard Lewis in the situation comedy series Anything but Love, which ran for four seasons from 1989 through 1992. For her performance as Hannah Miller, she received a People's Choice Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress   Television Series Musical or Comedy.[5]
1990-1999: Continued success and True Lies
Curtis received positive reviews for her performance in the action thriller Blue Steel (1990), which was directed by Kathryn Bigelow. The following year, she appeared in My Girl, opposite her Trading Places co-star Dan Aykroyd. The film was a great commercial success and was followed by a sequel, My Girl 2, in 1994. In 1992, Curtis starred alongside Mel Gibson in the romantic fantasy film Forever Young. The following year, she appeared in the psychological thriller Mother's Boys.
Curtis received critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for her work in the 1994 action-comedy film True Lies, directed by James Cameron.[5] The film was a critical and commercial success, becoming the 3rd highest-grossing film of 1994.[30] Her performance also earned Curtis her first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination.[31] She earned another Golden Globe Award nomination for her work in TNT's adaptation of the Wendy Wasserstein play The Heidi Chronicles (1995). In 1996, Curtis starred in the family comedy film House Arrest and appeared in an episode of the sitcom The Drew Carey Show.
Curtis appeared in Fierce Creatures in 1997, opposite her three A Fish Called Wanda costars: John Cleese, Kevin Kline, and Michael Palin. While the film was a modest commercial success, grossing $40 million worldwide against a $25 million budget,[32] it did not achieve the level of critical acclaim of its predecessor.[33] That same year, Curtis was inducted into the Fangoria Hall of Fame.
In 1998, she starred in the CBS television film Nicholas' Gift, for which she received an Primetime Emmy Award nomination, and reprised her role of Laurie Strode for the third time in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.[10] That same year, Curtis received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[34] In 1999, she starred in the science fiction horror film Virus, which was a critical and commercial flop. Curtis has since stated that she regrets starring in the film.[35]
2000-2006: Freaky Friday and retirement
In 2000, Curtis appeared in the crime comedy film Drowning Mona, starring Danny DeVito and Bette Midler. The following year, she starred as Geoffrey Rush's wife in the spy-triller film The Tailor of Panama and appeared in Billy Bob Thornton's Daddy and Them. Also in 2001, she voiced Queen Camilla in the computer-animated Christmas film Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys. She appeared in Halloween: Resurrection in 2002.
In 2003, Curtis was cast opposite Lindsay Lohan in the Disney comedy film Freaky Friday. The film was shot at Palisades High School in Pacific Palisades, California, near where Curtis and Guest lived with their children. Curtis received critical acclaim for her performance; A. O. Scott from The New York Times contended that she "does some of her best work ever",[36] while Entertainment Weekly called her performance "glorious".[37] Her performance earned her another nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress   Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.[5] She also received a Grammy Award nomination that same year for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for the audiobook The Jamie Lee Curtis Audio Collection.[38]
In 2004, she starred in the Christmas comedy film Christmas with the Kranks, which was critically derided but a box office success, and later went on to gain a cult following. The following year, she appeared as herself along her True Lies co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger in the comedy film The Kid & I. In October 2006, Curtis told Access Hollywood that she had closed the book on her acting career to focus on her family.[39]
2007-2017: Return to acting and Scream Queens
Curtis returned to acting after being cast in June 2007 in Disney's live-action-animated film Beverly Hills Chihuahua, starring opposite Piper Perabo as one of three live-action characters in the film. She also starred in the 2010 comedy film You Again, opposite Kristen Bell and Sigourney Weaver.[40] Curtis had voice roles in the animated films The Little Engine That Could and From Up on Poppy Hill (both 2011).
In 2012, she appeared in five episodes of the military drama series NCIS, playing the role of Dr. Samantha Ryan, a potential romantic interest of Special Agent Gibbs (Mark Harmon). During an interview, she stated that if they could develop a storyline, she would be interested to return to the series, but this never occurred.[41] The series reunited Curtis with Harmon, after he played her character's fianc  and later husband in the 2003 remake of Freaky Friday.[42] This was followed by supporting roles in the neo-noir mystery film Veronica Mars (2014) and the biographical drama film Spare Parts (2015). In 2016, IndieWire named her one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination[43] (Curtis received her first Academy Award nomination in 2023).[6]
From 2012 to 2018, Curtis had a recurring role as Joan Day, the mother of Zooey Deschanel's character, in the sitcom New Girl.[44] From 2015 to 2016, Curtis had a lead role as Cathy Munsch on the Fox satirical horror comedy series Scream Queens, which aired for two seasons. For her performance, she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress   Television Series Musical or Comedy.[5]
2018-present: Career resurgence and Oscar win
 Curtis at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival
Curtis returned to leading roles with her reprisal of Laurie Strode in the horror sequel film Halloween (2018). The film debuted to $76.2 million, marking the second-best opening weekend of October and the highest opening weekend of the Halloween franchise; and became the biggest domestic grosser in the franchise with its opening weekend alone.[45] Its opening performance was the best-ever for a film starring a lead actress over 55 years old.[46] Curtis's performance earned critical acclaim.[47] Also in 2018, she had a role in the drama film An Acceptable Loss. Her performance earned some positive critical notice; Chicago Sun-Times critic Richard Roeper stated that Curtis "creates a monster so terrifying she'd have Michael Myers turning tail and running away."[48]
In 2019, Curtis appeared as Linda Drysdale-Thrombrey, the eldest daughter of novelist Harlan Thrombey (played by Christopher Plummer) in Rian Johnson's mystery film Knives Out, which earned critical acclaim and over $300 million at the global box office.[49] The film was chosen by the American Film Institute, the National Board of Review, and Time magazine as one of the top ten films of 2019 in each respective list.[50][51]
In September 2021, she was honored with the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for her lifetime achievements.[52] Curtis again reprised her role as Laurie Strode in the horror sequels Halloween Kills, which was released in October 2021, and in Halloween Ends, which was released in October 2022.

Curtis's close friends Melanie Griffith and Arnold Schwarzenegger both honored her with speeches at the ceremony.[55]
