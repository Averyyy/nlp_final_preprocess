Rough and Ready is a census-designated place in Nevada County, California, United States.[2] It is located west of Grass Valley, California, approximately 62 miles (100 km) from Sacramento. The population was 963 at the 2010 census. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.[3]
History[edit]
The first established settlement in Rough and Ready was made in the fall of 1849 by a mining company from Wisconsin, known as the Rough and Ready Company, during the California Gold Rush.[4] Their leader, Captain A. A. Townsend, named the company after General Zachary Taylor (nicknamed "Old Rough and Ready") who had recently been elected the 12th President of the United States. Captain Townsend had served under Taylor when he commanded the American Forces during the Black Hawk War (1832). California had three towns so named of which this one survives.[5]
The town declared its secession from the Union as The Great Republic of Rough and Ready on 7 April 1850, largely to avoid mining taxes, but voted to rejoin the Union less than three months later on 4 July.[6] The old republic is celebrated annually as a way to attract tourism and as a point of local pride.
The post office at Rough and Ready was established by February 1851; the first postmaster was Marcus Nutting.[7] The ZIP Code is 95975. The community is inside area code 530.
The post office was closed for a time in 1855, again for a time in 1913, and again from 1942 to 1948.[8]
In 1988, the 49er Fire was accidentally started by a homeless and schizophrenic local man near Highway 49. The fire went on to burn well over a hundred homes and more than 33,000 acres in Nevada County, including structures in and around Rough and Ready.[9]
Present day[edit]
What little is left of the town is located on the Rough and Ready Highway. It was bypassed by State Route 20 in the mid-1980s.  Among the oldest buildings are the blacksmith shop (1850s), the Odd Fellows Hall (1854) (now Rough and Ready Grange Hall), and the Old Toll House.
The town of Rough and Ready is honored as a California Historical Landmark (#294).[10]

The town is defended by 'oddball miners" and "a sheriff who's afraid of guns".[17]
