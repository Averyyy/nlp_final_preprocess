Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a medical test that measures the amount of urea nitrogen found in blood. The liver produces urea in the urea cycle as a waste product of the digestion of protein.  Normal human adult blood should contain 6 to 20 mg/dL (2.1 to 7.1 mmol/L) of urea nitrogen.[1] Individual laboratories will have different reference ranges as the assay used can vary between laboratories.[2][3][4] The test is used to detect renal problems. It is not considered as reliable as creatinine or BUN/creatinine ratio blood studies.[1]
Interpretation[edit]
BUN is an indication of renal (kidney) health.  The normal range is 2.1 7.1 mmol/L or 6 20 mg/dL.[1]
The main causes of an increase in BUN are: high-protein diet, decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (suggestive of kidney failure), decrease in blood volume (hypovolemia), congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage,[5] fever, rapid cell destruction from infections, athletic activity, excessive muscle breakdown, and increased catabolism.[1]
Hypothyroidism can cause both decreased GFR and hypovolemia, but BUN-to-creatinine ratio has been found to be lowered in hypothyroidism and raised in hyperthyroidism.
The main causes of a decrease in BUN are malnutrition (low protein diet), severe liver disease, anabolic state, and  syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.[5]

Another rare cause of a decreased BUN is ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which is a genetic disorder inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. OTC deficiency is also accompanied by hyperammonemia and high orotic acid levels.
Units[edit]
BUN (urea-N) is mg/dL in the United States, Mexico, Italy, Austria, and Germany. Elsewhere, the concentration of urea is reported in SI unit as mmol/L, which is generally depending on the lab.

 represents the mass of nitrogen within urea/volume, not the mass of whole urea. Each molecule of urea has two nitrogen atoms, each of molar mass 14g/mol. To convert from mg/dL of blood urea nitrogen to mmol/L of urea:

Note that molar concentrations of urea and urea nitrogen are equal, because both nitrogen gas and urea has two nitrogen atoms.
