Salesforce, Inc. is an American cloud-based software company headquartered in San Francisco, California. It provides customer relationship management (CRM) software and applications focused on sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics, and application development.
Founded by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Salesforce quickly grew into one of the largest companies in the world, making its IPO in 2004. Salesforce's continued growth makes it the first cloud computing company to reach US$1 billion in annual revenue by fiscal year 2009,[2] and the world's largest enterprise software firm by 2022.[3]
Today, Salesforce is one of the largest technology companies in the world, and as of September 19, 2022, is the 61st largest company in the world by market cap with a value of nearly US$153 billion.[4] Salesforce ranked 136th on the most recent edition of the Fortune 500, making US$26.5 billion in 2022.[5] Since 2020, Salesforce has also been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[6]
History[edit]
 Salesforce's annual Dreamforce convention in 2022
Salesforce was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, together with Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a software as a service (SaaS) company.[7][8] Two of Salesforce's earliest investors were Larry Ellison, the co-founder and first CEO of Oracle, and Halsey Minor, the founder of CNET.[8]
Salesforce was severely affected by the dot-com bubble bursting at the beginning of the new millennium, with the company laying off 20% of its workforce. Despite its losses, Salesforce continued strong during the early 2000s. Salesforce also gained notability during this period for its "the end of software" tagline and marketing campaign, in which it also hired actors to hold up signs with its slogan outside a Siebel Systems conference.[9] Salesforce's revenue continued to increase from 2000 to 2003, with 2003's revenue skyrocketing from $5.4 million in the fiscal year 2001 to over $100 million by December 2003.[2]
Also in 2003, Salesforce held its first annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco.[10] In June 2004, the company had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol CRM and raised US$110 million.[11][12] In 2006, Salesforce launched IdeaExchange, a platform that allows customers to connect with company product managers.[13]
In 2009, Salesforce passed $1 billion in annual revenue.[8] Also, in 2009, the company launched Service Cloud, an application that helps companies manage service conversations about their products and services.[14]
In 2014, the company released Trailhead, a free online learning platform.[15] In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform.[16] In September 2016, Salesforce announced the launch of Einstein, an artificial intelligence platform that supports several of Salesforce's cloud services.[17][18]
In 2019, Salesforce joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing energy giant and Standard Oil-descendant ExxonMobil. Salesforce's ascension to the Dow Jones was concurrent with that of Amgen and Honeywell.[6] Because the Dow Jones factors its components by market price, Salesforce was the largest technology component of the index at its accession.[19]
Across 2020 and 2021, Salesforce saw some notable leadership changes; in February 2020, co-chief executive officer Keith Block stepped down from his position in the company.[20] Marc Benioff remained as chairman and chief executive officer.[21] In February 2021, Amy Weaver, previously the chief legal officer, became CFO. Former CFO Mark Hawkins announced that he would be retiring in October.[22][23] In November 2021, Bret Taylor was named vice chair and co-CEO of the company.[24]
In December 2020, it was announced that Salesforce would acquire Slack for $27.7 billion, its largest acquisition to date.[25] The acquisition closed in July 2021.[26] Journalists covering the acquisition emphasized the price Salesforce paid for Slack, which was a 54% premium compared to Slack's market value, as too high of a premium for the company, with views varying from the premium being too concerning for investors to Salesforce playing the long game.[27][28][29]
In August 2022, Salesforce reported second-quarter earnings of $7.72 billion. Upon the German software firm SAP reporting its earnings for the same quarter totaling  7.52 Billion,[a] Acceleration Economy reported that Salesforce had surpassed SAP to become the world's largest enterprise software vendor. This mirrored Benioff's remarks in Salesforce's earnings call, where he stated he looked at "this quarter very much as kind of a milestone".[3]
Salesforce announced a partnership with Meta Platforms in September 2022. The deal called that Meta's consumer application WhatsApp would integrate Salesforce's Customer 360 platform to allow consumers to communicate with companies directly.[30]
In November 2022, Salesforce announced it would terminate employees in its sales organization.[31] Protocol reported that the company would likely eliminate some 2500 jobs.[32]
In November 2022, Salesforce announced its co-CEO and vice chair, Bret Taylor, would be stepping down from his roles at the end of January 2023, with Benioff continuing to run the company and serve as board chair. Within the week, former Tableau CEO Mark Nelson and former Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield also announced their departures. When asked about the departures, Benioff stated, "people come and people go"; Salesforce's stock dropped to a 52-week low after Nelson's resignation.[33][34][35][36]
In January 2023, the company announced a layoff of about 10% or approximately 8,000 positions. According to Benioff, the company hired too aggressively during the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in working from home. The company will also reduce office space as part of the restructuring plan.[37] The same month brought an announcement from activist investor Elliott Management that it would acquire a "big stake" in the company.[38]
Services[edit]

Salesforce Platform[edit]
Salesforce Platform[43] (formerly known as Force.com) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[44][failed verification] These third-party applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[45]
Force.com applications are built using declarative tools, backed by Lightning[further explanation needed] and Apex, a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com,[46] as well as Visualforce, a framework[47] including an XML[48] syntax typically used to generate HTML. The Force.com platform typically receives three complete releases a year.[49] As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.
In 2015, a new framework for building user interfaces   Lightning Components   was introduced in beta.[50] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[51] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's JavaScript dependency.
As of 2014, the Force.com platform has 1.5 million registered developers.[52]
Lightning Base Components is the component library built on top of Lightning Web Components.[53]
AppExchange[edit]
Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace that connects customers with third-party applications and consulting services.[54][55] As of 2021, the exchange has over 5,000 apps listed.[56][57]

The service features original content produced by the company involving its clients ranging from "days in the life" of smaller business owners to interviews with large companies' CEOs. Since 2022, Salesforce has also streamed its annual Dreamforce conference on Salesforce+.[60][61]

Culture[edit]
According to Marc Benioff, Salesforce corporate culture is based on the concept of Ohana.[73]
In 2021, Cynthia Perry, a design research senior manager, resigned, alleging discrimination in the workplace and posting her resignation letter on LinkedIn.[74][75]
On September 10, 2021, Benioff tweeted that the company is prepared to help any employee who wishes to move out of the state of Texas, following the abortion in Texas legislation announced on September 1, 2021.[76]

Criticisms[edit]
Subject to a phishing attack[edit]
In November 2007, a phishing attack compromised contact information on a number of Salesforce customers. Some customers then received phishing emails that appeared to be invoices from Salesforce.[119][120] Salesforce stated that "a phisher tricked someone into disclosing a password, but this intrusion did not stem from a security flaw in [the salesforce.com] application or database."[119]
 Meatpistol  presenters let go at Def Con[edit]
In 2017, at DEF CON, two security engineers were let go after giving a presentation on an internal project called MEATPISTOL.[121] The presenters were sent a message 30 minutes prior to the presentation telling them not to go on stage, but the message wasn't seen until after they finished.[121][122] The MEATPISTOL tool was anticipated to be released as open-source at the time of the presentation, but Salesforce didn't release the code to developers or the public during the conference.[121] The terminated employees called on the company to open-source the software after being let go.[123]
RAICES donation refusal[edit]
The not-for-profit organization Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) rejected a US$250,000 donation from Salesforce because the company has contracts with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.[124]
2018 taxes[edit]
In December 2019, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that Salesforce was one of 91 companies who "paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less" in 2018, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Their findings were published in a report based on the 379 Fortune 500 companies that declared a profit in 2018.[125]
Lawsuit[edit]
In March 2019, Salesforce faced a lawsuit by 50 anonymous women claiming to be victims and survivors of sex trafficking, abuse, and rape. The suit alleges that the company profited from and helped build technology that facilitated sex trafficking on Backpage.com, a now defunct website.[126] In March 2021, a judge granted partial dismissal of the case, dismissing charges of negligence and conspiracy, but allowed the case to proceed regarding charges of sex trafficking.[127]

This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2023)
In July 2021, Salesforce Japan faced a discrimination lawsuit from a former employee, according to Japanese legal media,[128] at a time when the firm has been publicly challenged about its commitment to equality[citation needed]. The firm declined to comment on the suit to the media. The ex-employee, who has Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD, claimed she was discriminated against because of her disability and terminated in the firm s Japan web marketing team.
The suit alleged that the anonymous woman, as an employee at Salesforce Japan from 2018 to 2020, faced hate speech, microaggressions and rejection of reasonable accommodation from the manager. She alleged that her attempts to resolve the problem were met with pressure from HR and job coach. The lawsuit started on September 15 in Tokyo district court. The 8th trial will open on November 14, 2022.[129][130]
Employee layoffs/Matthew McConaughey s salary[edit]
In January 2023, Salesforce reported that 8,000 employees had been laid off as a result of over-hiring during the Covid lockdown and a global economic downturn. In March 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported that actor Matthew McConaughey was paid 10 million dollars yearly for his role as a  creative advisor and TV pitchman . American musician will.i.am was also cited to be on the company s payroll due to his  strong understanding of technology .[131][132]
Salesforce Ventures[edit]
In 2009, Salesforce began investing in startups.[133] These investments became Salesforce Ventures, headed by John Somorjai[133][134] In September 2014, SFV set up Salesforce1 Fund, aimed at start-ups creating applications primarily for mobile phones.[135] In December 2018, Salesforce Ventures announced the launch of the Japan Trailblazer Fund, focused on Japanese startups.[136]
