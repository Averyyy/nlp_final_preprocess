Father's Day is a holiday of honoring fatherhood and paternal bonds, as well as the influence of fathers in society. In Catholic countries of Europe, it has been celebrated on 19 March as Saint Joseph's Day since the Middle Ages. In the United States, Father's Day was founded by Sonora Smart Dodd,[1][2][3] and celebrated on the third Sunday of June for the first time in 1910. The day is held on various dates across the world, and different regions maintain their own traditions of honoring fatherhood. Sikhs celebrate Father's Day (   ) on 29 December, Birthday of Guru Gobind Singh.
Father's Day is a recognized public holiday in Lithuania and some parts of Spain and was regarded as such in Italy until 1977. It is a national holiday in Estonia, Samoa, and equivalently in South Korea, where it is celebrated as Parents' Day. The holiday complements similar celebrations honoring family members, such as Mother's Day, Siblings Day, and Grandparents' Day.
History[edit]
Early history[edit]
For centuries, the Eastern Orthodox Church has appointed the second Sunday before Nativity as the Sunday of the Forefathers to commemorate the ancestors of Christ according to the flesh, starting with Adam and emphasizing the Patriarch Abraham, to whom God said,
 In thy seed shall all of the nations of the earth be blessed  Genesis 12:3, 22:18
This feast can fall between 11 and 17 December.[4][5]  This feast includes the ancestors of the Mary, mother of Jesus and various prophets.
A customary day for the celebration of fatherhood in Catholic Europe is known to date back to at least 1508. It is usually celebrated on 19 March, as the feast day of Saint Joseph, who is referred to as the fatherly Nutritor Domini ("Nourisher of the Lord") in Catholicism and "the putative father of Jesus" in southern European tradition. This celebration was brought to the Americas by the Spanish and Portuguese. The Catholic Church actively supported the custom of a celebration of fatherhood on St. Joseph's Day from either the last years of the 14th century or from the early 15th century,[6] apparently on the initiative of the Franciscans.[7]
In the Coptic Orthodox Church, the celebration of fatherhood is also observed on St Joseph's Day, but the Copts observe this on 20 July. The Coptic celebration may date back to the fifth century.[6]
Whether to celebrate this day worldwide or not remained a debatable topic. In 1908, Grace Golden Clayton proposed the day to honor those men who had died in a mining accident in the US. Though it was not accepted then, in 1909 Sonora Smart Dodd, who along with her five brothers was raised by her father alone, after attending Mother's Day in a church, convinced the Spokane Ministerial Association to celebrate Father's Day worldwide.[8]
In addition to Father's Day, International Men's Day is celebrated in many countries on 19 November in honor of both men and boys.[9]

Main article: Kushe Aunsi
The Nepalese Hindus as well as the Newars in Nepal honors fathers on the day of Kushe aunsi (Nepali:    ), which occurs in late August or early September, depending on the year, since it depends on the lunar calendar. According to Hindu calendar, the festival falls on the new moon day of Bhadra month.[54] It is also known as Gokarna Aunsi or Pitri Tirpani Aunsi.
In recent years, Nepalese non Hindus have also adopted the Kushe Aunsi day.[54] It is commonly known as Buwaako mukh herne din (Nepali:        , lit. 'day for looking at father's face') or Abu ya Khwa Swoyegu in Nepal Bhasa.[32][55] The celebration of the festival has been modernized in some ways in recent years. Children worship their father on this day, put tika on his forehead and give him sweets, delicacies and gifts as a part of celebration. In return, the father bless good fortune to his children.
On the new moon day (Amavasya), it is traditional to pay respect to one's deceased father; Hindus go to the Shiva temple of Gokarneswor Mahadev, in Gokarna, a suburb of Kathmandu[56] while Buddhists go to Jana Bahal (Seto Machhendranath or white Tara) temple in Kathmandu.
Traditionally, in the Kathmandu Valley, the south-western corner is reserved for women and women-related rituals, and the north-eastern is for men and men-related rituals. The worship place for Mata Tirtha Aunsi ('Mother Pilgrimage New Moon') is located in Mata Tirtha in the south-western half of the valley, while the worship place for Gokarna Aunsi is located in the north-eastern half. This division is reflected in many aspects of the life in the Kathmandu Valley.[57]

Regardless of age or gender, this day is also an opportunity to reaffirm that traditional filial piety is a crucial norm and cultural value in modern society. The ceremony to mark Parents' Day as an anniversary and put on carnations stems from a Christian culture. As Western religions and cultures entered, this holiday, which was introduced together, became the most traditional holiday combined with Confucian filial piety in the process of establishing itself.

Main article: Public holidays in Taiwan
In Taiwan, Father's Day is not an official holiday, but is widely observed on 8 August, the eighth day of the eighth month of the year. In Mandarin Chinese, the pronunciation of the number eight is b , and the pronunciation is very similar to the character   (b ), which means "pa" or "dad". The eighth day of the eighth month (b -b ) is a pun for dad ( ; b ba). Taiwan, therefore, sometimes refer to 8 August as "B b  Holiday" as a pun for "Dad's Holiday" ( ) or the more formal "Father's Day" ( ).[65]
Thailand[edit]
In Thailand, Father's Day is observed on 5 December, the birthday of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX).[30] In Thailand, Father's Day, as well as Mother's Day, are national public holidays. Traditionally, Thais celebrate by giving their father or grandfather a canna flower ( , Dok Buddha Raksa), which is considered a masculine flower; however, this is not as commonly practiced today. Thai people will wear yellow on this day to show respect for the late king, because yellow is the color of the day for Monday, the day King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born. Thais flood the Sanam Luang, a massive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual speech, and often stay until the evening when there is a national ceremony. Thais will light candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This ceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at Thai organizations.[66]
It first gained nationwide popularity in the 1980s as part of a campaign by Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda to promote Thailand's royal family.[30] Mother's Day is celebrated on the birthday of Queen Sirikit,[30] 12 August.

In 1950, they introduced "la F te des P res", which would take place every third Sunday of June (following the American example). Their slogan "Nos papas nous l'ont dit, pour la f te des p res, ils d sirent tous un Flaminaire" (Our daddies told us, for Father's Day, they all want a Flaminaire). In 1952, the holiday was officially decreed. A national Father's Day committee was set up to give a prize for fathers who deserved it most (originally, candidates were nominated by the social services of each town hall's/mayor's office); This complements la F te des M res (Mother's Day) which was made official in France in 1928 and added to the calendar in Vichy in 1941.[77]
Germany[edit]
 Hiking tour on Father's Day with smaller wagons.
In Germany, Father's Day (Vatertag) is celebrated differently from other parts of the world.[78] It is always celebrated on Ascension Day (the Thursday forty days after Easter), which is a federal holiday. Regionally, it is also called gentlemen's day, Herrentag. It is a tradition for groups of males (young and old but usually excluding pre-teenage boys) to do a hiking tour with one or more smaller wagons, Bollerwagen, pulled by manpower. In the wagons are wine or beer bottles (according to the region) and traditional regional food, Hausmannskost. Many men use this holiday as an opportunity to get drunk.[78] According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, alcohol-related traffic accidents treble on this day.[79] The tradition of Father's Day is especially prevalent in Eastern Germany.[78]
These traditions are probably rooted in Christian Ascension Day's processions to the farmlands, which has been celebrated since the 18th century.[80][81] Men would be seated in a wooden cart and carried to the village's plaza, and the mayor would award a prize to the father who had the most children, usually with a big piece of ham.[80] In the late 19th century the religious component was progressively lost, especially in urban areas such as Berlin, and groups of men organized walking excursions with beer and ham.[80] By the 20th century, alcohol consumption had become a major part of the tradition.[80][82] Many people will take the following Friday off work, and some schools are closed on that Friday as well; many people then use the resulting four-day-long weekend for a short vacation.

Children exclaim "bonne f te papa", while everyone wishes all fathers "bonne F te des P res" (Happy Father's Day).
Mexico[edit]
In Mexico, Father's Day is celebrated on the third Sunday of June and is not a public holiday.[108] Father's Day typically involves spending time with one's father or the father figures in one's life. Small family gatherings and the giving of gifts may be part of the festivities organized for Father's Day.

Main article: Father's Day (United States)
In the US, Father's Day is celebrated on the third Sunday of June.[110] Typically, families gather to celebrate the father figures in their lives. Schools (if in session) and other children's programs commonly have activities to make Father's Day gifts.[111]
Oceanian traditions[edit]
Australia[edit]
In Australia, Father's Day is celebrated on the first Sunday of September, which is the first Sunday of spring in Australia. Most families present fathers with gifts and cards, and share a meal. It is not a public holiday.
The idea of Father's Day wasn't initially well received in Australia in the 1910s and 1920s. Many thought it was either unnecessary or undermined a father's assumed  supremacy  as head of the household. Newspapers at the time printed satirical poems and critical editorials of the new American tradition.[112] Father's Day was originally observed in June, matching the USA date, with church services and the wearing of a red flower.[113] In June 1925, Janet Heyden of Sydney (who also advocated for Mother's Day celebrations in Australia) began collecting donations to bring cheer to elderly men in nursing homes. While Mother's Day became instantly popular, it wasn't until the 1930s that Father's Day came to be popularly celebrated in Australia on the first Sunday in September. The Father's Day Council of Australia was established in 1957 and continues to honor distinguished fathers with an annual Australian Father of the Year award. Father's Day traditions in Australia include school crafts with handmade gifts and cards from younger children, taking dad out for lunch, BBQs, and outdoor family activities. Public schools often hold a Father's Day gift stall with inexpensive presents for fathers, grandfathers, carers, or other role-models.
YMCA Victoria continues the tradition of honoring the role fathers and father figures play in parenting through the annual awarding of Local Community Father of the Year in 32 municipalities in Victoria. The Father's Day Council of Victoria also annually recognizes fathers in the Victorian Father of the Year Award.[114]
New Zealand[edit]
In New Zealand, Father's Day is celebrated on the first Sunday of September and it is not a public holiday. Father's Day was first observed at St Matthew's Church, Auckland on 14 July 1929[115] and first appeared in commercial advertising the following year.[116] By 1931 other churches had adopted the day and in 1935 much of Australia moved to mark the day at the beginning of September.[117] New Zealand followed this, with a Wellington advert in 1937[118] and a Christchurch Salvation Army service in 1938.[119]
Samoa[edit]
In Samoa, Father's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday in August, and is a recognized national holiday on the Monday following.
Fiji[edit]
In Fiji, Father's Day is celebrated in September. Commercial fathers Sunday is usually on the first Sunday and then the Methodist Father's Day is usually celebrated on the second Sunday.
South American traditions[edit]
Argentina[edit]
Father's Day in Argentina is celebrated on the third Sunday of June.
Attempts have been made to change the date to 24 August, to commemorate the day on which the "Father of the Nation", Jos  de San Mart n, became a father.[14] In 1953, the proposal to celebrate Father's Day in all educational establishments on 24 August, in honor of Jos  de San Mart n, was raised to the General Direction of Schools of Mendoza Province. The day was celebrated for the first time in 1958, on the third Sunday of June, but it was not included in the school calendars due to pressure from several groups.[120]
Schools in the Mendoza Province continued to celebrate Father's Day on 24 August, and in 1982 the provincial governor passed a law declaring Father's Day in the province to be celebrated on that day.[120]
In 2004, a proposal to change the date to 24 August was presented to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies as a single, unified project.
Bolivia[edit]
In Bolivia Father's Day (D a del padre, in Spanish) is celebrated on 19 March (Saint Joseph Day). People usually give a present to their fathers and spend time with them.
Brazil[edit]
In Brazil Father's Day (Dia dos Pais, in Portuguese) is celebrated three months after Mother's Day, on the second Sunday of August. Publicist Sylvio Bhering picked the day in honor of Saint Joachim, patron of fathers. While it is not an official holiday (see Public holidays in Brazil), it is widely observed and typically involves spending time with and giving gifts to one's father or father figure.
Chile[edit]
In Chile Father's Day (D a del padre, in Spanish) is officially celebrated on 19 June.[121]
Colombia[edit]
In Colombia, Father's Day (D a del padre, in Spanish) is celebrated on the third Sunday of June. In 2022, it was officially celebrated on 26 June to avoid coinciding with the second round of the presidential elections.[122]
Paraguay[edit]
In Paraguay, Father's Day is typically celebrated with a traditional banquet of Paraguayan food like chipa, mbeju, bori, soyo and sopa paraguaya. In Paraguay Father's Day is a very important day, and is celebrated with much fervor.
