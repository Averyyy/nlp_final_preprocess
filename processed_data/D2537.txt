Notes
^ These figures may incorporate populations of secular/nominal adherents as well as syncretist worshipers, although the concept of syncretism is disputed by some.
^ Nonreligious includes agnostic, atheist, secular humanist, and people answering 'none' or no religious preference. Half of this group is theistic but nonreligious.[4] According to a 2012 study by Gallup International "59% of the world said that they think of themselves as religious person, 23% think of themselves as not religious whereas 13% think of themselves as convinced atheists".[5]
^ Chinese traditional religion is described as "the common religion of the majority Chinese culture: a combination of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, as well as the traditional non-scriptural/local practices and beliefs."

Data is ranked by mean estimate in parentheses. Irreligious includes agnostic, atheist, secular people, and those having no formal religious adherence. It does not necessarily mean that those of this group don't belong to any religion. Some religions have harmonized with local cultures and can be seen as a cultural background rather than a formal religion. Additionally, the practice of officially associating a family or household with a religion, while not formally practicing the affiliated religion, is common in many countries. Thus, over half of this group is theistic and/or influenced by religious principles, but nonreligious/non-practicing and not true atheists or agnostics.[4] See Spiritual but not religious.

Taoists/Confucians/Chinese traditional religionists
As a spiritual practice, Taoism has made fewer inroads in the West than Buddhism and Hinduism. Despite the popularity of its great classics the I Ching and the Tao Te Ching, the practice of Taoism has not been promulgated in America with much success;[77] these religions are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of bigger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. Nonetheless, Taoist ideas and symbols such as Taijitu have become popular throughout the world through Tai Chi Chuan, Qigong, and various martial arts.[78]

Ethnic and indigenous religionists
Indigenous statistics come from the U.S. Department of State International Religious Freedom Report (2009),[88] based on the highest estimate of people identified as indigenous or followers of indigenous religions that have been well-defined. Due to the syncretic nature of these religions, the numbers may not reflect the actual number of practitioners.

The Sikh homeland is the Punjab state, in India, where Sikhs make up approximately 58% of the population. This is the only place where Sikhs are in the majority. Sikhs have emigrated to countries all over the world   especially to English-speaking and East Asian nations. In doing so they have retained, to an unusually high degree, their distinctive cultural and religious identity.
Sikhs are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of larger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. But they can be found in many international cities and have become an especially strong religious presence in the United Kingdom and Canada.[112] Sikhism is also the fastest growing religion in New Zealand and Australia.[113][114]

^ The United States Census does not ask about religious affiliation.[150] Sikh organizations estimate the Sikh American population to be as high as 750,000.[151][152] Before the United Kingdom Census started asking about religion in 2001, Sikh organizations estimated the British Sikh population to be as high as 750,000, but the 2001 census found the British Sikh population to be only 336,149.[153][154][155][156][157][158] Thus, population figures by Sikh organizations are likely overestimates. A comprehensive 2012 survey by the Pew Research Center estimated that 1% of Asian Americans and 5% of Indian Americans are Sikhs,[159] which would yield a Sikh population of approximately 200,000 in 2012 and 290,000 in 2021.[160][161]
The most comprehensive way to estimate the Sikh American population is by comparing to the Punjabi American population.[162] Out of the 4,060,554 Americans who spoke a South Asian language at home in 2021, 318,588, or 7.85%, spoke Punjabi at home. This indicates that Punjabi Americans make up 7.85% of the South Asian American population of 5,492,692, and thus number 430,952.[163][164][165][166][167] This matches with a comprehensive 2020 survey of Indian Americans by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which found that 8% of Indian Americans were Punjabi.[168] Using this same method, the populations of Punjabi Canadians, English Punjabis, and Punjabi Australians can be estimated at 1,146,900, 931,671, and 319,377 respectively, using language data from censuses conducted in 2021 in those nations.[169][170][171] Those nations also ask about religion in their censuses, with there being 771,790 Sikh Canadians, 520,092 English Sikhs, and 210,400 Sikh Australians in 2021.[172][173][174]Thus, the Sikh population was about 62.65% of the Punjabi population in those three countries combined. Using this ratio, the American Sikh population can be estimated at 269,986 in 2021. This ratio can also be used to estimate Sikh populations of American states, counties, and communities using population data of Punjabi speakers.
