The cubic foot (symbol ft3 or cu ft)[1] is an imperial and US customary (non-metric) unit of volume, used in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of one foot (0.3048 m) in length. Its volume is 28.3168 L (about 1 35 of a cubic metre).
At 60 F (16 C), a cubic foot of water weighs 62.37 pounds (28.29 kg).

Symbols and abbreviations[edit]
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot is ft3.[1] The following abbreviations are used: cubic feet, cubic foot, cubic ft, cu feet, cu foot, cu ft, cu.ft, cuft, cb ft, cb.ft, cbft, cbf, feet3, foot3, ft3, feet/-3, foot/-3, ft/-3.[citation needed]
Larger multiples are in common usage in commerce and industry in the United States:
CCF or HCF: Centum (Latin hundred) cubic feet; i.e., 100 ft3
Used in the billing of natural gas and water delivered to households.
MCF: Mille (Latin thousand) cubic feet; i.e., 1000 ft3
MMCF: Mille mille cubic feet; i.e., 1000000 ft3
MMCFD: MMCF per day; i.e., 1000000 ft3/d
Used in the oil and gas industry.
BCF or TMC: Billion or thousand million cubic feet; i.e., 1000000000 ft3
TMC is usually used for referring to storage capacity and actual storage volume of storage dams.
TCF: Trillion cubic feet; i.e., 1000000000000 ft3
Used in the oil and gas industry.
Cubic foot per second and related flow rates[edit]
"Cusec" redirects here. For other uses, see Canadian University Software Engineering Conference.
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot per second is ft3/s.[1] The following other abbreviations are also sometimes used:
ft3/sec
cu ft/s
cfs or CFS
cusec
second-feet
The flow or discharge of rivers, i.e., the volume of water passing a location per unit of time, is commonly expressed in units of cubic feet per second or cubic metres per second.
Cusec is a unit of flow rate,[2] used mostly in the United States in the context of water flow, particularly of rivers and canals.
Conversions: 1 ft3s 1 = 0.028316847 m3 s 1 = 28.316847 L s 1 = 1.699 m3 min 1 = 1699 L min 1
Cubic foot per minute[edit]
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot per minute is ft3/min.[1] The following abbreviations are used:
cu ft/min
cufm
cfm or CFM
cfpm or CFPM
Cubic feet per minute is used to measure the amount of air that is being delivered, and is a common metric used for carburettors,[3] pneumatic tools, and air-compressor systems.[4]
Standard cubic foot[edit]
Main articles: Standard cubic foot and Standard cubic foot per minute
A standard cubic foot (abbreviated scf) is a measure of quantity of gas, sometimes[clarification needed] defined in terms of standard temperature and pressure as a cubic foot of volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 C; 288.71 K) and 14.7 pounds per square inch (PSI) (1.01 bar; 101.35 kPa) of pressure.[citation needed]
