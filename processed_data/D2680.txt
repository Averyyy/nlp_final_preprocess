The following is a list of recurring and minor characters in the Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. These characters were regularly rotated, often disappearing for long periods during the series.
Tipton staff[edit]
Arwin Hawkhauser[edit]
Arwin Quentin Hawkhauser (played by Brian Stepanek)   A wacky Greek-American inventor who works as a stationary engineer for the Tipton. He is friends with Zack, Cody, and Maddie in the series.  As shown in many episodes, he has a massive crush on Carey but is too afraid to act upon it. He hates carrots and is allergic to horses, as shown in "Free Tippy". Every time Carey kisses him, he faints, as seen in "Kisses & Basketball", "Bowling", and "Going for the Gold". His affection is also shown in his office which has a picture of Carey, as well as a cardboard cutout of her, which he claims to his cousin is his wife. Arwin was a professional bowler, as illustrated in "Bowling", but quit when he lost his ball on the backswing and hit his mother in the head, shrinking her by a foot during a championship match. He is also known for being obsessed with his mother; he lived with her his whole life until she got married and moved out. Arwin is considered childlike by many characters in the show; he enjoys picture books, sleeps with a sock monkey, and eats a lunch packed by his mother. However, Arwin is much loved by Zack and Cody. A spin-off television series was planned about him, where he goes to live with his sister to help her take care of her children. The series name ideas consisted of "Arwin" and "Housebroken", though it was never picked up.
Arwin makes a guest appearance in The Suite Life on Deck via web chat on Cody's laptop in the episode "It's All Greek To Me". Also, in the episode, it's revealed that he has a cousin named Milos in Greece (also played by Stepanek). In the episode "Computer Date", Arwin boards a ship and creates a supercomputer dubbed "Cal" (until he found out it was female, renaming her "Callie") to make the SS Tipton run more efficiently. However, it all goes downhill when Callie develops romantic feelings for Cody, causing her to go haywire and start to remove everyone else, and Arwin is forced to shut her down. At the end of the episode, Arwin attempts to get off the ship by using a giant magnet, but it fails, and he falls into the ocean. In "A London Carol", Mr. Moseby mentions Arwin when London Tipton gets stuck in the past. Arwin makes his final appearance in "Graduation on Deck", finally meeting the twins' real father Kurt, and briefly claiming that he is their stepfather.
Esteban[edit]
Esteban (played by Adrian R'Mante)  The head bellman at the Tipton. His signature quotes are "This is a disaster!" and "Oh, Mr. Moseby!" He is very close to his heritage, which is revealed to be Peruvian in "I Want My Mummy". He is friends with Zack, Cody, and Maddie. It is revealed during the series that his full name is "Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ram rez". He owns a domestic chicken with blue feet named Dudley. Esteban wants to manage the Tipton, and he is a gifted dancer. He addresses the twins, Zach & Cody, as "little blond peoples", even when he is only talking to one of them, in which case he often has to correct himself. Though he frequently does stupid, na ve, or clumsy things, he is more intelligent than he is given credit for and has a huge heart, which is shown throughout the series. In the dancing episode, after he and the nurse, Shannon Quine, dance, they are briefly shown kissing. It is also stated he is descended from royalty in several episodes and in one becomes temporarily rich because of his royal family. However, his royal family is deposed. In "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel" it is revealed that Esteban has a crush on Carey. He guest-stars on The Suite Life on Deck in which he has his wedding on the SS Tipton with Francesca (Marisa Ramirez).  It is also revealed in that episode that he has been promoted from bellhop to assistant night manager of the hotel. Being a recurring character, Esteban has appeared frequently throughout the show, only absent in a handful of episodes.
Lance Fishman[edit]
Lance Fishman (played by Aaron Musicant)   The Tipton's handsome if somewhat slow-witted young lifeguard, who projects a relaxed and easy going demeanour, but harbours an almost unhealthy obsession with water. He is frequently shown in scenes trying to steer even the most mundane everyday conversations to swimming, the ocean, or sea creatures in some respect. He disrupts Maddie's student film ("Back in the Game") by insisting that she change his character to a merman, and suggesting she replace the front walk with a pool so that he can swim, rather than walk, to the hotel entrance. Later, during London's Halloween party he appears as "the Mighty Lobster". Nonetheless, Lance exhibits remarkable ease with picking up women, scoring dates with both Maddie (who at first had a crush on him) and London (despite her aversion to dating "the help"). Holding onto said women is another story: Maddie dumps him because she finds him dull, and London agrees to break up with him after he meets a woman called Wanda.
Wilfred Tipton[edit]
Wilfred Tipton (voiced by Bob Joles)   Wilfred Tipton is the owner of Tipton hotels & resorts and father to London Tipton. Until The Suite Life on Deck episode, "Twister: Part 3", his face had never been shown. He is usually surrounded by his bodyguards, with only his hand shown. It is not clear how he became the owner of the Tipton, because London mentions many times that her father bought the hotel. However, in a few episodes, it is said that Tipton's ancestors owned the hotel first before he did. This may yet be another example of London's ignorance, or a continuity error or that the Tiptons have not owned it for some time and he bought it back. In the episode "Rock Star in the House", Wilfred is very strict about London's behaviour when it comes to celebrities, and has much concern for her education and growing as a person. His hand was once seen in the episode "Lip Synchin' in the Rain", in which he was wearing a diamond ring. Wilfred Tipton also has a history of marrying much younger women without London's consent, most of whom do not last long. The warranty of Wilfred's wedding gifts (given by Mr. Moseby) lasted longer than the marriages.
In The Suite Life on Deck episode, "Twister: Part 3", Wilfred Tipton (played by John Michael Higgins) finally reveals himself, who is called by a reluctant Cody trying to rescue the Pickett Farm, although Wilfred Tipton buys the destroyed house to build a plastic bag factory. Cody tries to force Mr. Tipton out of the area by saying the dirt in the area contains powerful diseases, but Zack and Woody ruin the plot when they used peeling skin (Mr. Tipton said he watched a movie involving peeling skin). However, his daughter, London, seeing the strong emotions from the group, blackmails Wilfred. After the blackmail, Mr. Tipton leaves, but not before telling London he is proud of her.
Muriel[edit]
Muriel (played by Estelle Harris; young Muriel played by Ashley Tisdale in flashback in the episode "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel")   The saucy hotel maid who conceals her goodly nature beneath a veneer of acidic sarcasm, and spends more time sneaking in naps and robbing guests of loose change than doing any actual cleaning. She is a constant presence in Carey and the twins' suite, ostensibly "babysitting" but loitering on their couch watching TV and eating chocolates long after Carey has returned home. In "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Hotel", the cast discovers that Muriel once dated mobster Alphonse "Hot Peppers" DeLeo before joining the Tipton in 1938; Maddie and the twins easily spot her in an old newspaper clipping when they notice that the young lady in the picture is sitting with her feet up. In "Big Hair & Baseball", Muriel claims that she knew Babe Ruth and was the first one to call him "Babe". Her catchphrase is, "I'm not cleaning that up." She was specially called out of retirement in the series finale "Mr Tipton comes to Visit", by the twins, when they heard the reason for Mr. Tipton's visit is to fire an employee, in order for her to "get fired" instead (using her catchphrase), sparing the other characters their respective jobs.
Nia Moseby[edit]
Nia Moseby (played by Giovonnie Samuels)   Nia is Mr. Moseby's niece. She has a part-time job at the candy counter, filling in for Maddie during her absence. She has come to work at the Tipton so that Mr. Moseby can get her to behave like a responsible girl. One of Nia's aunts, named Aunt Lilly, was supposed to take on this task, but Nia frustrated her so much that she changed her name and moved to Alaska. Nia appeared in seven episodes in Season 3. According to Mr. Moseby, she was expelled from her last school for fighting with the cafeteria lady because she was out of matzo ball soup. In the episode "First Day of High School", she is seen defending Zack from a bully. She is shown to be quite good at cheerleading in the episode "Benchwarmers".
Norman[edit]
Norman (played by Anthony Acker)   The doorman for the Tipton Hotel, Norman's first appearance was in the episode "Free Tippy". He is also usually a background character, but is shown to have a hiding spot for Zack's belongings when he skips school in "What the Hey". Norman has four speaking parts in the episodes, "Neither a Borrower Nor a Speller Bee', "Ask Zack', "Nurse Zack" and "The Arwin That Came For Dinner".
Patrick[edit]
Patrick (played by Patrick Bristow)   The ma tre d' for the Tipton Hotel's restaurant. One of the most sarcastic characters on the show, he treats everyone with disdain, especially Zack and Cody. However, in "Kisses and Basketball", he says to Zack "Take this from someone who cares about you, she is so out of your league" on Zack's date with Max. He likes coconut flavoured chewing gum, and dislikes Maddie because she does not stock it (as shown in the episode "Big Hair and Baseball"). He is seen in the Tipton Commercial in "Commercial Breaks", and has a girlish shriek, as shown in the episode "Heck's Kitchen". Due to London's generous tips, Patrick has been able to afford a foreign sports car (indicated in "Twins at the Tipton"). However, Mr. Moseby claims that Patrick wrecked it by crashing into fellow waiter Rich, and when the ambulance showed up, another waiter Gary got hit by the ambulance, leaving Mr. Moseby to take Patrick's place at the Tipton Restaurant. His favourite musical is Bye Bye Birdie as revealed in "Birdman of Boston".
Chef Paolo[edit]
Chef Paolo (played by Jerry Kernion)   An Italian-American chef of the Tipton, seen in three episodes: "Heck's Kitchen", "Health and Fitness", and "Foiled Again". He is easily very insulted when people dislike his cooking. He is specialized in Italian food. Paolo enjoys eating, and bacon bits were found in his blood during a cholesterol test. Cody helped Chef Paolo overcome his eating issues in the episode "Health and Fitness". He is close to Cody and refers to him as "my little protege", because of Cody's natural talent for cooking. Paolo has quit his job several times (mostly due to London insulting his food), but always returns eventually. He names almost all of his foods after himself, except for one named after Cody.
Irene[edit]
Irene (played by Sharon Jordan)   The concierge for the Tipton Hotel, Irene is usually seen working in the lobby. She has red curly hair. In "Boston Tea Party", she gets her first speaking part. On "That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana", Irene told Raven that her flight had been cancelled, much to Raven's dismay. Irene sabotaged Maddie's traveling candy cart in "Nurse Zack", to which Maddie alludes to Irene not having very many speaking parts by replying, "It's always the quiet ones". In "Orchestra", her speaking role was expanded when she had to teach London how to do her job. On "Let Us Entertain You', Mr. Moseby thinks Irene is answering a phone call for their marathon, but she is actually answering a personal call.
Millicent[edit]
Millicent (played by Kara Taitz)   Maddie's replacement at the hotel's candy counter while she is at camp and in Antarctica saving the penguins. Millicent is easily frightened by anything, and has trouble making up her mind and make her decision. When she can't make up her mind, she usually faints. She stated in the episode "Team Tipton" that she has trust, abandonment, and fear issues. She frequently faints when overwhelmed with a request from someone else. In the episode "Team Tipton", London referred to her as 'Nervous Maddie'.
Skippy[edit]
Skippy (played by Bo Crutcher)   The night-manager of the Tipton Hotel, he grew up in a farm and said his grandfather was scary. He is not very bright, and appears to be frightened of Mr. Moseby. He is so dim-witted that immediately after Mr. Moseby told him not to let Zack or Cody into the exhibit, he let them in anyway. He first appeared in "Scary Movie", but Mr. Moseby called him Sparky, although it is possible that Mr. Moseby did not know his name, because he called him his night-manager while in other episodes he calls him Skippy. Skippy was left in charge of the hotel in the episode "I Want My Mummy". Zack says that Skippy is so nice, that he would give anyone anything if they just asked, even his wallet.
Grace[edit]
Grace (played by Naomi Chan)   An emotionless towel maid at the Tipton who appeared in "Ah! Wilderness" while Carey was painting. In "Orchestra", she is given the name Grace and attempts to teach London how to do her job.

Zack meets him in school one day when he was moved into a regular class from a special education class because he was doing so well in it.

After they visited the Tipton in Boston for a twin convention (as seen in "Twins at the Tipton") they enrolled in Zack and Cody's school.

He is known as the more fun and spontaneous parent and plays a red Fender Precision Bass in a rock band in which he leads.

Ilsa[edit]
Ilsa Shickelgrubermeiger (played by Caroline Rhea)   Ilsa is the mean-spirited German hotel inspector-turned-manager of the rival hotel, the St. Mark Hotel, across the street. She is a rude and severe woman with a large mole (or "beauty mark") on her face (which is oblivious to her, as she usually replies "Vat mole?"), who dislikes Mr. Moseby for making her lose her hotel inspector's job. After "Hotel Inspector", she got married. In "Cookin' With Romeo and Juliet" she says her name is Ilsa Shickelgrubermeiger-Von Helsinger Kepelugerhoffer. When Cody mentions that it must take forever to write on her underwear, she says she has a stamp. One of her dreams is to turn the Tipton Hotel into a parking lot, and have Mr. Moseby park the cars. In "Bowling", it appears that she has an odd sense of humor, as she says, "Left! Left! Left my husband with 28 kids! Right! Right! Right in the middle of the living room floor!" Some parts of her personality seem to be reminiscent of the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz; for instance, in the episode "Bowling" she states, "I'll get you next time, my pretty, and your little shtaff too!" She also uses the line, "I'll get you next time and your little dog too', in the episode "Hotel Inspector". In the episode "Bowling", Mr. Moseby makes a reference to The Biggest Loser, the show Caroline Rhea hosted, by saying "Ha! Who's the biggest loser now!" Also in that episode, she actually compliments Carrie on her parenting skills by keeping Zack off the team as punishment for pranking Cody; however, she then follows it up with the insult that it's also bad coaching as Zack's the second-best bowler the Tipton team had. It is mentioned in a few episodes that she has a sausage dog named Blitzkrieg, who is rather vicious, merciless, and sadistic. London likened the dog to a piranha. Everyone is afraid of her and constantly stares at her mole.
The Mirrors[edit]
The Mirrors (voiced by Brian Peck in the original series; and Michael Airington in the sequel series) are London's free-standing talking mirrors (it was mentioned that there are more than one). They first appeared in the season 2 crossover episode That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana. London stated that the mirrors were engineered by her father's scientists, and that they are programmed to only compliment her fashion while giving snobby fashion insults to others who stand in front of them. The mirror sounds like Paul Lynde who played Uncle Arthur in the series. It is implied several times that the mirrors have artificial intelligence, as they regularly make sarcastic comments about London's intelligence. The Mirror is a parody of the Magic Mirror used by Queen Grimhilde (The Evil Queen) from the fairy tale Snow White. The Mirror re-appears in the Suite Life on Deck season 3 episode "A London Carol" representing the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future in London's dream and also in the Suite Life On Deck season 2 episode "Once Upon a Suite Life" literally as the Magic Mirror from Snow White.
George[edit]
Mr. George Forgess (played by Ernie Grunwald)   One of Zack and Cody's teachers from "Smart & Smarterer". He is often shown as a nervous character and frequently stumbles over his words. It may be possible that he is dyslexic, like his special education student Bob, a friend of the twins. He later appears in "A Midsummer's Nightmare" as runner of the drama club, and in "Graduation" as the head of Zack and Cody's graduation. Mr. Forgess claims he drives his mother's car, which he says has chrome spinners. Mr. Forgess has appeared in three episodes throughout the series.
Snooty[edit]
Snooty Saleswoman (played by Donna Cherry)   She appears in "Not So Suite 16" and "What the Hey". Snooty works in the jewelry and clothing department of a store. She dislikes the twins, and worships London Tipton. An example of her London worship is the time she insulted and patronized Carey until she found out that Carey knew London. The Snooty Saleswoman has appeared in two episodes throughout the series.
Portia[edit]
Portia Tenenbaum   The never seen, rich frenemy of London. In some episodes, they are friends and in other episodes, they are competitors. The two speak by telephone and go on shopping trips together (most of times to Paris). In the episode "Neither a Borrower Nor a Speller Bee", Portia had gained publicity doing charity works. London also competes with her for more fame on the Internet with her own web show called "Yay Me! Starring London Tipton".  In "Cody Goes to Camp" Mr. Moseby was horrified at the thought that Portia might teach London how to drive as she once drove her father's yacht through piers 10, 11 and 12, because of being distracted putting on sunscreen. She is never seen.
Arturo Vitali[edit]
Arturo Vitali is a fictitious famous fashion designer who is mentioned multiple times in the Suite Life franchise. He happens to be London's favourite designer, as she has been wearing his designs since she was in diapers, and only wears his designs. In The Suite Life of Zack & Cody crossover episode That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana, Maddie and Esteban switched the labels of one of Vitali's dresses (incorrectly spelled as A. Vitalli) and Raven Baxter's dress, to fool London into thinking she was wearing Vitali's design (but actually it was Raven's), since London was being a fashion-snob. Arturo Vitali finally made an appearance in The Suite Life on Deck episode "Frozen" (portrayed by Todd Sherry), where he retired to the SS Tipton because he was suffering from a creative block. London and Bailey eventually helped him overcome his creative block and inspired him to launch a new fashion line "Hick Chic" (inspired by Bailey's wardrobe), much to London's chagrin, who doesn't like Bailey's clothes. He is mentioned by Emma Ross in the season 2 episodes of Jessie "Trashin' Fashion", and then again in "Say Yes to the Messy Dress" where he sent Emma one of his designs for Jessie Prescott to wear at a Red carpet event, which Emma would be covering on her hit fashion web-show "Kitty Couture".

They both appear in "Miniature Golf" as part of London's so-called book club and in "Who's The Boss?" while Chelsea was in the episode "Tiptonline" as a guest and temporary producer on London's web show "Yay Me". In "Who's the Boss" they have British accents. Tiffany has appeared in two episodes throughout the series, and Chelsea has been in three.

Animals[edit]
While some of these animals appeared in only one episode, and therefore weren't physically recurring, they were mentioned in several episodes so their characters were recurring. For this reason they are included in this article.
Dudley   Esteban's pet chicken. He appeared on the episode "Commercial Breaks". After that, Esteban mentions him in some episodes. He appeared again on "Suite Life on Deck",  in the episode "Mother of the Groom".
Scamp (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui)   Maddie's pet dog. In the episode "Crushed", he and Ivana, London's dog, fall in love and Ivana has six puppies. When "talking" to Ivana he notes that he has one flea but it is only there on weekends.
Ivana (voiced by Emma Stone)   London's spoiled dog. She is a Pomeranian, and appears to be a lot smarter than London. In the episode "Crushed", she and Scamp, Maddie's dog, fall in love and she has six puppies. She is a parody of Tinkerbell Hilton.
Bonnie and Clyde   Two rats that Zack and Cody used in a science project. Named after the infamous bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.
