Francois Henri LaLanne (/l le n/;[1] September 26, 1914   January 23, 2011) was an American fitness and nutrition guru and motivational speaker. He described himself as being a "sugarholic" and a "junk food junkie" until he was aged 15. He also had behavioral problems, but "turned his life around" after listening to a public lecture about the benefits of good nutrition by health food pioneer Paul Bragg. During his career, he came to believe that the country's overall health depended on the health of its population, and referred to physical culture and nutrition as "the salvation of America."[2]
Decades before health and fitness began being promoted by celebrities like Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons, LaLanne was already widely recognized for publicly preaching the health benefits of regular exercise and a good diet.[3] He published numerous books on fitness and hosted the fitness television program The Jack LaLanne Show from 1951 to 1985. As early as 1936, at the age of 21, he opened one of the nation's first fitness gyms in Oakland, California,[2] which became a prototype for dozens of similar gyms bearing his name.[4] One of his 1950s television exercise programs was aimed toward women, whom he also encouraged to join his health clubs.[2][5] He invented a number of exercise machines, including the pulley and leg extension devices and the Smith machine. Besides producing his own series of videos, he coached the elderly and disabled not to forgo exercise, believing it would enable them to enhance their strength.[2][5]
LaLanne also gained recognition for his success as a bodybuilder, as well as for his prodigious feats of strength. On the occasion of LaLanne's death, Arnold Schwarzenegger credited LaLanne for being "an apostle for fitness" by inspiring "billions all over the world to live healthier lives,"[6] and, as governor of California, had earlier placed him on his Governor's Council on Physical Fitness. Steve Reeves credited LaLanne as his inspiration to build his muscular physique while keeping a slim waist.
LaLanne was inducted into the California Hall of Fame and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[7]
Early life[edit]
LaLanne was born in San Francisco, California,[3][2] the son of Jennie (n e Garaig) and Jean/John LaLanne, French immigrants from Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Both entered the U.S. in the 1880s as young children at the Port of New Orleans. LaLanne had two older brothers, Ervil, who died in childhood (1906 1911), and Norman (1908 2005), who nicknamed him "Jack."[2] He grew up in Bakersfield, California and later moved with his family to Berkeley, California circa 1928. In 1939, his father died at the age of 58 in a San Francisco hospital,[8] which LaLanne attributed to "coronary thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver." In his book The Jack LaLanne Way to Vibrant Health, LaLanne wrote that as a boy he was addicted to sugar and junk food.[9] He had violent episodes directed against himself and others, describing himself as "a miserable kid ... it was like hell."[10]
Besides having a bad temper, LaLanne also suffered from headaches and bulimia, and temporarily dropped out of high school at the age of 14. The following year, aged 15, he heard health food pioneer Paul Bragg give a talk on health and nutrition, focusing on the "evils of meat and sugar."[11] Bragg's message had a powerful influence on LaLanne, who then changed his life and started focusing on his diet and exercise.[12] In his own words, he was "born again," and besides his new focus on nutrition, he began working out daily (although while serving during World War II as a Pharmacist Mate First Class at the Sun Valley Naval Convalescent Hospital, LaLanne stated that he started in bodybuilding at "age 13").[13] Describing his change of diet, LaLanne stated, "I had to take my lunch alone to the football field to eat so no one would see me eat my raw veggies, whole bread, raisins and nuts. You don't know the crap I went through."[14]
Writer Hal Reynolds, who interviewed LaLanne in 2008, notes that he became an avid swimmer and trained with weights; he described his introduction to weight lifting thus:
[LaLanne] found two men working out in a back room, who kept weights in a locked box. When he asked them if he could use their weights, they laughed at him and said, "Kid, you can't even lift those weights." So he challenged them both to a wrestling match with the bet that if he could beat them, they would give him a key to the box. After he beat them both, they gave him a key and he used their weights until he was able to buy his own.[14]
LaLanne went back to school, where he made the high school football team, and later went on to college in San Francisco where he earned a Doctor of Chiropractic degree. He studied Henry Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body and concentrated on bodybuilding and weightlifting.[11]
Fitness career[edit]
Health clubs[edit]
In 1936, he opened the nation's first health and fitness club in Oakland, California,[11] where he offered supervised weight and exercise training and gave nutritional advice. His primary goal was to encourage and motivate his clients to improve their overall health. Doctors, however, advised their patients to stay away from his health club, a business totally unheard of at the time, and warned their patients that "LaLanne was an exercise 'nut,' whose programs would make them 'muscle-bound' and cause severe medical problems."[11] LaLanne recalls the initial reaction of doctors to his promotion of weight-lifting:
People thought I was a charlatan and a nut. The doctors were against me they said that working out with weights would give people heart attacks and they would lose their sex drive.[5]
LaLanne designed the first leg extension machines, pulley machines using cables, and the weight selectors that are now standard in the fitness industry.[citation needed] He invented the original model of what became the Smith machine.[15] LaLanne encouraged women to lift weights (though at the time it was thought this would make women look masculine and unattractive). By the 1980s, Jack LaLanne's European Health Spas numbered more than 200. He eventually licensed all his health clubs to the Bally company, now known as Bally Total Fitness.  Though not associated with any gym, LaLanne continued to lift weights until his death.[citation needed]
LaLanne's gym ownership led to a brief professional wrestling career in 1938.[citation needed]  Wrestlers were among the few athletes who embraced weight training, and they frequented his health club. LaLanne wrestled in the Bay Area for only a few months. He was well respected enough that he was booked to wrestle to a draw against some big name opponents rather than lose, despite his lack of experience. According to Ad Santel's grandson David Ad Santel, LaLanne wanted to be a champion from the start, but did not have the wrestling skills to do so.[citation needed] LaLanne was also friendly with such performers as Lou Thesz and Strangler Lewis.[citation needed]
Books, television and other media[edit]
 Jack LaLanne in 1961
LaLanne presented fitness and exercise advice on television for 34 years. The Jack LaLanne Show was the longest-running television exercise program.  According to the SF Chronicle TV program archives, it first began on 28 September 1953 as a 15-minute local morning program (sandwiched between the morning news and a cooking show) on San Francisco's ABC television station, KGO-TV, with LaLanne paying for the airtime himself as a way to promote his gym and related health products.  LaLanne also met his wife Elaine while she was working for the local station.  In 1959, the show was picked up for nationwide syndication, and continued until 1985.[citation needed]
The show was noted for its minimalist set, where LaLanne inspired his viewers to use basic home objects, such as a chair, to perform their exercises along with him. Wearing his standard jumpsuit, he urged his audience "with the enthusiasm of an evangelist," to get off their couch and copy his basic movements, a manner considered the forerunner of today's fitness videos.[11][16]: watch  In 1959, LaLanne recorded Glamour Stretcher Time, a workout album that provided phonograph-based instruction for exercising with an elastic cord called the Glamour Stretcher.[17]  As a daytime show, much of LaLanne's audience were stay-at-home mothers.  Wife Elaine LaLanne was part of the show to demonstrate the exercises, as well as the fact that doing them would not ruin their figures or musculature.  LaLanne also included his dog Happy as a way to attract children to the show.  Later in the run, another dog named Walter was used, with LaLanne claiming "Walter" stood for "We All Love To Exercise Regularly."[citation needed]
LaLanne published several books and videos on fitness and nutrition, appeared in movies, and recorded a song with Connie Haines. He marketed exercise equipment, a range of vitamin supplements, and two models of electric juicers.[18] These include the "Juice Tiger," as seen on Amazing Discoveries with Mike Levey, and "Jack LaLanne's Power Juicer."[19] It was on the show that LaLanne introduced the phrase "That's the power of the juice!" However, in March 1996, 70,000 Juice Tiger juicers, 9% of its models, were recalled after 14 injury incidents were reported.[19] The Power Juicer is still sold in five models.[20]
LaLanne celebrated his 95th birthday with the release of a new book titled, Live Young Forever.[21]
Personal health routine[edit]
Diet[edit]
LaLanne blamed overly processed foods for many health problems. For most of his life, Jack was mostly vegetarian while including fish in his evening meal.[22][failed verification] In his later years, he appeared[vague] to advocate a mostly meatless diet that included fish,[23][24] and took vitamin supplements.[25][26][27]
He ate two meals a day and avoided snacks. His breakfast, after working out for two hours, consisted of hard-boiled egg whites, a cup of broth, oatmeal with soy milk, and seasonal fruit. For dinner, he and his wife typically ate raw vegetables, egg whites, and fish. He did not drink coffee.[5]
Exercise[edit]
When exercising, LaLanne worked out repetitively with weights until he experienced "muscle fatigue" in whatever muscle groups he was exercising, or when it became impossible for him to go on with a particular routine; this is most often referred to as "training to failure." LaLanne moved from exercise to exercise without stopping. To contradict critics who thought this would leave him tightly musclebound and uncoordinated, LaLanne liked to demonstrate one-handed balancing. His home contained two gyms and a pool that he used daily.[5]
 LaLanne receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007 at Muscle Beach in Venice Beach, California
He continued with his two-hour workouts into his 90s, which also included walking.[28] He stated, "If I died, people would say 'Oh look, Jack LaLanne died. He didn't practice what he preached.'"[5]
LaLanne summed up his philosophy about good nutrition and exercise:
Dying is easy. Living is a pain in the butt. It's like an athletic event. You've got to train for it. You've got to eat right. You've got to exercise. Your health account, your bank account, they're the same thing. The more you put in, the more you can take out. Exercise is king and nutrition is queen: together, you have a kingdom.[29]
Views on food additives and drugs[edit]
LaLanne often stressed that artificial food additives, drugs, and processed foods contributed to making people mentally and physically ill. As a result, he writes, many people turn to alcohol and drugs to deal with symptoms of ailments, noting that "a stream of aches and pains seems to encompass us as we get older."[30]: 114  He refers to the human bloodstream as a "River of Life," which is "polluted" by "junk foods" loaded with "preservatives, salt, sugar, and artificial flavorings."[30]: 167 
Relying on evidence from The President's Council on Physical Fitness, he also agreed that "many of our aches and pains come from lack of physical activity." As an immediate remedy for symptoms such as constipation, insomnia, tiredness, anxiety, shortness of breath, or high blood pressure, LaLanne states that people will resort to various drugs: "We look for crutches such as sleeping pills, pep pills, alcohol, cigarettes, and so on."[30]
Family[edit]
LaLanne was married to his second wife, Elaine Doyle LaLanne, for over five decades. They had three children: a daughter named Yvonne LaLanne from his first marriage, a son named Dan Doyle from Elaine's first marriage, and a son named Jon LaLanne together. Yvonne is a chiropractor in California; Dan and Jon are involved in the family business, BeFit Enterprises, which they and their mother and sister plan to continue.[2][10][31]  Another daughter from Elaine's first marriage, Janet Doyle, died in a car accident at age 21 in 1974.[32]
Death[edit]
LaLanne died of respiratory failure due to pneumonia at his home on January 23, 2011. He was 96. According to his family, he had been sick for a week, but refused to see a doctor. They added that he had been performing his daily workout routine the day before his death.[33] He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California.[34]
LaLanne's feats[edit]
(As reported on Jack LaLanne's website)  These accounts are not necessarily entirely accurate descriptions of what LaLanne actually did.  See the 1974 Alcatraz Island to Fisherman's Wharf swim (below) for an illustration of the difference between the website account and objective reporting of the same event.[citation needed]
1954 (age 40) Swam the entire 8,981-foot (1.7 mi; 2.7 km) length of the Golden Gate in San Francisco, under water, with 140 lb (64 kg; 10 st) of air tanks and other equipment strapped to his body; a world record.[35]
1955 (age 41) Swam from Alcatraz Island to Pier 43 in San Francisco while handcuffed.[36][37] When interviewed afterwards, he was quoted as saying that the worst thing about the ordeal was being handcuffed, which significantly reduced his ability to do a jumping jack.[citation needed]
1956 (age 42) Set what was claimed as a world record of 1,033 push-ups in 23 minutes on You Asked For It,[38]  a television program hosted by Art Baker.
1957 (age 43) Swam the Golden Gate channel while towing a 2,500 lb (1,130 kg; 180 st) cabin cruiser. The swift ocean currents turned this one-mile (1.6 km) swim into a swimming distance of 6.5 miles (10.5 km).[35]
1958 (age 44) Maneuvered a paddleboard nonstop from Farallon Islands to the San Francisco shore. The 30-mile (48 km) trip took 9.5 hours.[citation needed]
1959 (age 45) Did 1,000 push-ups and 1,000 chin-ups in 1 hour, 22 minutes, to promote The Jack LaLanne Show going nationwide.  LaLanne said this was the most difficult of his stunts, but only because the skin on his hands started ripping off during the chin-ups.  He felt he couldn't stop, because it would be seen as a public failure.[35]
1974 (age 60) For the second time, he swam from Alcatraz Island to Fisherman's Wharf. Again, he was handcuffed, but this time he was also shackled and towed a 1,000 lb (450 kg; 71 st) boat, according to his obituary in Los Angeles Times in 2011 and his website.[39] However, according to an account of this event published the day after it occurred in the Los Angeles Times, written by Philip Hager, a Times staff writer, LaLanne was neither handcuffed nor shackled if each of those terms has the conventional meaning of "tightly binding the wrists or ankles together with a pair of metal fasteners." Hager says that LaLanne "had his hands and feet bound with cords that allowed minimal freedom."  But "minimal" clearly did not mean "no" freedom, since elsewhere in the article Hager describes LaLanne's method of propulsion through the water as "half-breast-stroke, half-dog paddle" which is how you swim with your hands tied.[citation needed]
1975 (age 61) Repeating his performance of 21 years earlier, he again swam the entire length of the Golden Gate Bridge, underwater and handcuffed, but this time he was shackled and towed a 1,000 lb (450 kg; 71 st) boat.[citation needed]
1976 (age 62) To commemorate the "Spirit of '76," United States Bicentennial, he swam one mile (1.6 km) in Long Beach Harbor. He was handcuffed and shackled, and he towed 13 boats (representing the 13 original colonies) containing 76 people.[40]
1979 (age 65) Towed 65 boats in Lake Ashinoko, near Tokyo, Japan. He was handcuffed and shackled, and the boats were filled with 6,500 lb (2,950 kg; 460 st) of Louisiana Pacific wood pulp.[41]
1980 (age 66) Towed 10 boats in North Miami, Florida. The boats carried 77 people, and he towed them for over one mile (1.6 km) in less than one hour.[citation needed]
1984 (age 70) He towed 70 rowboats, one with several guests, from the Queen's Way Bridge in the Long Beach Harbor to the Queen Mary, 1 mile.[42]
