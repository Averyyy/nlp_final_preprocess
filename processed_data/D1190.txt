The definition of world's busiest airport has been specified by the Airports Council International in Montreal, Canada.[1] The ACI defines and measures the following three types of airport traffic:
Passenger traffic: total passengers embarked and disembarked, passengers in transit counted once[2]
Cargo traffic: loaded and unloaded freight and mail, by mass[3]
Traffic movements: landings and take-offs of aircraft[4]
Busiest airports[edit]
The following airports make claims based on objective volume measures that are defined above (as per ACI):
Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia, United States
Most passengers annually (1998 2019, 2021 present)[5][6]

Historical claims[edit]
Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois, United States
In the late 1940s, Chicago Midway was the busiest airport in the United States by total aircraft operations   i.e., including every training aircraft practicing take-offs and landings.[12] New York LaGuardia had the most airline operations and passengers until the early 1950s, when Chicago Midway became the busiest airport in the United States by any criterion. Before World War II, Chicago Midway was the origin or destination of one in four U.S. airline flights,[13] although a 1939 Official Aviation Guide shows more airline flights scheduled at Newark than at Chicago.[citation needed]
Memphis International Airport, Memphis, Tennessee, United States
As the home of FedEx Express, Memphis had the largest cargo operations worldwide from 1993 to 2009. It remains the busiest cargo airport in the United States and the Western Hemisphere.[14]
