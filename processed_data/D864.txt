The Temple Owls  are the athletic teams that represent Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The current athletic director is Arthur Johnson.
The owl has been the symbol and mascot for Temple University since its founding in the 1880s. Temple was the first school in the United States to adopt the owl as its symbol or mascot. The owl, a nocturnal hunter, was initially adopted as a symbol because Temple University began as a night school for young people of limited means. Russell Conwell, Temple's founder, encouraged these students with the remark: "The owl of the night makes the eagle of the day."
Affiliation[edit]
The Owls are primarily members of the American Athletic Conference (The American).  Since their football team participates in the NCAA's Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. The football program was a member of the Big East Conference until its expulsion after the 2004 season due to a variety of program shortcomings.  Temple played a limited MAC schedule in 2005 and 2006 before becoming an affiliated football-only member and playing a full 8-game league schedule in 2007. The school's men's basketball team is part of the Big Five, the traditional designation for the rivalries between the Owls and their Philadelphia rivals:  Penn, Saint Joseph's, Villanova, and La Salle. Temple considers the rivalry with St. Joe's to be the most intense, especially in basketball. St. Joe's, however, considers this rivalry to be secondary to their rivalry with Villanova.
The landscape of Temple sports changed in the early 2010s, thanks to a major realignment of Division I conferences. Temple football returned to the Big East in 2012, and then became a full member of the renamed American Athletic Conference in July 2013, after being a full member (non-football) of the A-10 since the early '80s. The Owls are an affiliate member of The Big East for Field Hockey and the East Atlantic Gymnastics League for gymnastics.
As of the 2023 conference realignment, they are one of two schools in the American (along with Wichita State) to have never been a member of Conference USA.
Achievements[edit]
Temple University was among the first institutions in the United States to sponsor extracurricular athletic activities for its students. Both the football and basketball programs were inaugurated in 1894 under the direction of Coach Charles M. Williams.

Men's basketball[edit]
Main article: Temple Owls men's basketball
 Liacouras Center, home of Temple Owls basketball and volleyball teams since 1997
In 1938, the Owls, who finished with a 23 2 record, won the inaugural National Invitation Tournament by routing Colorado, 60 36, in the championship final. Because the NCAA tournament was not held until the following year, Temple's NIT championship earned the Owls national title recognition. The team was also retroactively named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[3][4]
During the 1950s, the Temple basketball team made two NCAA Final Four appearances (1956, 1958) under Head Coach Harry Litwack. Litwack would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame after concluding a 21-year coaching career that included 373 wins. Head Coach John Chaney, also a Hall of Famer, won a total of 724 career games and took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times. His 1987 88 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked No. 1 in the country, and he has reached the Elite Eight on five occasions. He was consensus national coach of the year in 1988. Former NBA players Eddie Jones of the Miami Heat, Aaron McKie of the Los Angeles Lakers, Rick Brunson of the New York Knicks, and Mardy Collins, formerly of the Los Angeles Clippers, are also part of Temple's basketball heritage.[citation needed]
On March 13, 2006, Hall of Fame head coach John Chaney retired.
On April 10, 2006, University of Pennsylvania head coach and La Salle University alumnus Fran Dunphy was named Temple's new men's head basketball coach. Dunphy had coached the Quakers for 17 straight seasons prior to the move.  Dunphy and his Owls won the Atlantic-10 tournament in 2008 beating St. Joseph's University. The Owls were rewarded with a 12 seed in the NCAA tournament and paired against 5th-seeded Michigan State, losing that game 72 61. In 2009, the Owls won their second consecutive Atlantic-10 tournament against Duquesne, for their conference leading 13th title.
Entering the 2021 22 season, Temple men's basketball program ranked fifth in NCAA All-Time wins with 1945.
Football[edit]
 Temple beats Penn State for first time since 1941
Main article: Temple Owls football
The Owls football team participates in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision, but because the A-10 supported football only at the Football Championship Subdivision level (1997 2006), they maintained separate league affiliation for football. They were a member of the Big East Conference until their expulsion after the 2004 season due to a variety of program shortcomings; they played a limited Mid-American Conference schedule in 2005 and 2006 before becoming a completely affiliated football-only member and playing a full 8-game MAC league schedule in 2007. In December 2005, Al Golden, the defensive coordinator for the University of Virginia, was named head coach, replaced Bobby Wallace. He would accumulate a 27 34 record before moving to the Miami (FL).  With the improvement to Temple's football program, the school was invited to rejoin the Big East Conference as an associate member for football for 2012 and as a full member for all sports in 2013. By the time Temple returned to full membership, the Big East had split along football lines into a new, non-football Big East Conference and the football-sponsoring American Athletic Conference, with Temple joining The American. On December 23, 2010, Steve Addazio, then offensive coordinator at the University of Florida, was named head coach to continue and build upon the foundation Golden had left.
2015 was a breakout year for the program. The Owls won 10 out of 12 regular season games, including victories over Penn State, Cincinnati and a 4-point loss in the waning minutes to Notre Dame, with an AAC Championship game-clinching victory over bowl-bound UConn in the final game of the season. For the first time in generations, the Temple Owls were ranked in the AP, Coaches and College Football Playoff polls for half the season.
Baseball[edit]
Main article: Temple Owls baseball
Temple's baseball program was in existence from 1927 to 2014, and played in two College World Series. Its winningest coach, James "Skip" Wilson, guided the Owls to 901 career wins. The team played in the NCAA Tournament a total of 14 times, and advanced to the NCAA College World Series in 1972 and 1977. The Owls were three-time A-10 Champions (1983, 1984, 2001) since joining the league in 1983.[5]
Temple played its home games at Skip Wilson Field in Ambler, a Philadelphia suburb, from 2004 to 2014.  After the 2014 season, the program was cut to comply with Title IX.[6]
Rugby[edit]
Temple plays every year at the Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC). The CRC is the highest profile college rugby tournament in the country, and is played every year at PPL Park in Philadelphia, and is broadcast live on NBC.  Temple is one of the local favorites at the CRC, and is considered to have "the best fans, as they put in time and effort and noise to cheer for their teams."[7] One opposing coach stated that the Temple fans at PPL Park were "the greatest fan advantage I've ever seen."[8]
Temple Rugby has been one of the most successful sports at Temple University since its inception in 1980.[9] Temple has won the Mayor's Cup and Liberty Cup multiple times. Temple has qualified for the EPRU championships three years in a row, and in 2003 won the Division II EPRU championships. Temple played in the Division II title game in 2010, but lost to Claremont 25 19. Temple's success resulted in its promotion in 2010 to the Division I level.[9] Temple now plays in the Keystone Conference against local rivals such as St. Joseph's University.[10] In their first season in Division 1, Temple posted a 12 2 record,[11] and advanced to the 2011 Division I National Collegiate Rugby Championship playoffs, where they reached the round of 16 before losing to top seeded Bowling Green.[12] Temple rugby is funded by the University, alumni, and student fundraising.[13]
Soccer[edit]

Since taking over in 2016, Perkins has taken the Owls to their first Henley Royal Regatta since 1994 after sweeping the Dad Vail Regatta in record fashion. Prior to being named head coach, Perkins spent seven seasons as the assistant coach and top recruiter.[16]
Prior to Perkins, Dr. Gavin R. White, coached Temple for 37 seasons before retiring at the end of the 2015-16 season. Under White's guidance, the Owls  earned international distinction with seven invitations to Great Britain's premiere regatta, the renowned Henley Royal Regatta (1983 86, 1989, 1990, 1994). In Temple's seven appearances, White has led the Owls to the Grand Finale once (1984) and into the quarterfinals four times (1985, 1990, 1993, 1994).[17]

Track and Field[edit]
In track and field, Eulace Peacock remains a giant in the history of the sport. In the mid-1930s, Peacock brought national attention to himself and the Temple program with a string of sprinting victories over famed Ohio State and Olympic Games star Jesse Owens.
Women's sports[edit]
As early as 1923, the University's women began participating on club sport teams. In fact, that year, Coach Blanche Voorhees guided an Owl basketball team to a perfect 12 0 record and also started a field hockey program. Additional sports for women followed: swimming in 1926, tennis in 1939, fencing in 1946, softball in 1949, lacrosse in 1957, and finally volleyball, track and field in 1975. The modern era took root in 1974, when Temple named physical education instructor Veronica "Ronnie" Maurek to the dual role of head basketball and softball coach. When Maurek chose to coach only softball three years later, the University went outside the physical education department for the first time to hire its first modern-day full-time women's basketball coach, Andy McGovern.
Basketball[edit]
Main article: Temple Owls women's basketball
Andy McGovern, who was Temple's first full-time women's basketball coach, produced the Owls' first winning season of the modern era with a 14 10 mark in the 1979 80 season.
