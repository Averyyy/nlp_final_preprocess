Early life[edit]
McCreery was born on October 9, 1993, in Garner, North Carolina, the son of Judy (n e Cooke) and Michael McCreery.[8][9] His parents originally planned on naming him Evan, but changed their minds on their way to the hospital.[3] McCreery is of one quarter Puerto Rican descent; his father, a manufacturing systems analyst for Schneider Electric, was born in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, to a military father and a Puerto Rican mother from San Juan, both of whom later moved to Aberdeen, North Carolina.[10][11][12] McCreery's mother is a real estate agent for Fonville Morisey.[13][14] She also owns a tanning salon in Clayton, North Carolina.[13] McCreery's older sister, Ashley, attended UNC Charlotte.[12][15] Both were raised in Garner.[12][16][17]
Around the age of five or six, McCreery received a book about Elvis Presley from his grandmother, and Elvis became McCreery's earliest musical influence.[18][19][20] He began learning guitar when he was around nine or ten years old.[13][21]
McCreery attended Timber Drive Elementary School in Garner, West Lake Middle School in Apex, and Garner Magnet High School .[13][22] He participated in all three schools' choruses,[13][17][23] and he also sang at his middle school graduation.[21] He sang tenor as a freshman in high school, where he was named Rookie of the Year. In his second year, he switched to singing bass and began singing in his church.[24] He also starred in a school production of Bye Bye Birdie that year, playing the role of Conrad Birdie.[13] McCreery went on to join a vocal ensemble called Die Meistersingers that was formed by his high school chorus teacher, Meredith Clayton, and with which he performed across the United States.[24]
In 2009, McCreery won a singing contest called "Clayton Idol", which was held by WQDR-FM at the Clayton Harvest Festival in Clayton, North Carolina. After winning, he held several local shows with the radio station, raising money for sick children.[23][25] Later the same year, he was one of thirty-six finalists in a contest called Rip the Hallways, which featured teenage vocalists from across North Carolina.[21] On the eve of Valentine's Day, 2010, McCreery performed in a variety show called Gift 4, which was held by the town of Garner.[26][27][28] In April of that year, he performed at the second annual Boots, Bands, and Bulls benefit concert. Funds from the concert went to Brittany's Battle, a Garner-based nonprofit that supports those affected by cancer. The concert was held in Raleigh, and country singer Jason Michael Carroll also performed.[26][29]
Growing up, McCreery attended First Baptist Church in Garner. He led the church's youth praise band, Audience of One.[30][31] In addition to his musical pursuits, McCreery was a member of his high school baseball team. His coach, Derik Goffena said of him, "He doesn't throw terribly hard. His best pitch is a curveball as far as getting people out. If he had to start he probably wouldn't walk more than one or two in a game."[24] McCreery was working as a bagger at Lowes Foods when he auditioned for American Idol.[12]
American Idol[edit]
Overview[edit]
 McCreery in 2011
McCreery auditioned for the tenth season of American Idol in Milwaukee, at the age of sixteen. He originally planned on auditioning in Nashville, but decided not to when he discovered that the date conflicted with an annual church camp. He sang "Your Man" by Josh Turner and "Put Some Drive in Your Country" by Travis Tritt for his audition,[8] and then reprised "Your Man" for his first Hollywood Week performance.[32] For the subsequent Group Round, he joined with Jacee Badeaux, Frances Coontz, Clint Jun Gamboa, and Monique de los Santos. Calling themselves "The Guaps", they chose to perform "Get Ready" by The Temptations. However, during a late stage of their preparation, Gamboa decided that Badeaux was not contributing enough to the group and forced him to leave. Before the performance, McCreery apologized to the judges for letting this happen. All five singers advanced to the next round.[33][34][35]
For his second Hollywood Week solo performance, McCreery sang "I Hope You Dance" by Lee Ann Womack. He was not familiar with the lyrics and forgot them onstage. Afterward, he said that he did not feel that he deserved to go forward in the competition. The judges decided to give him another chance though,[36] and following a well-received performance of Josh Turner's "Long Black Train", selected him as one of the twenty-four contestants that would move forward to the voting rounds of the competition.[37][38]
McCreery did not venture far out of the country genre throughout the competition,[39][40][41] although one of his most acclaimed performances was of Carole King's "You've Got a Friend".[42][43][44][45] Taking note of season eight winner Kris Allen's success with a stripped-down version of the rap song "Heartless", McCreery considered doing an acoustic version of a hip-hop or R&B song, such as "So Sick" by Ne-Yo or something by Charlie Wilson. Instead, he went with Montgomery Gentry's "Gone", a country song with rap-like cadences.[46] It was regarded by some as his best moment of the finals.[47][48]
On making the Top 3, McCreery and the other remaining finalists earned celebratory hometown visits.[49] While back in Garner, McCreery made an appearance at his high school's prom, threw the first pitch at a baseball game between the North Carolina State Wolfpack and the Florida State Seminoles, and performed for a crowd of around thirty-thousand at Lake Benson Park. He was joined by his guitar teacher, Gary Epperson and Epperson's band, Gavinhart.[13] As McCreery was singing Josh Turner's "Your Man", Turner himself surprised McCreery onstage and joined him for the song.[50][51]
McCreery entered the finale with fellow country singer Lauren Alaina,[52] with whom he had shared duets several times that season.[44][45][53][54] This was the youngest match-up in the history of the series. Alaina was sixteen at the time, and McCreery had turned seventeen since auditioning.[52] He went on to become the series' youngest male winner and second youngest winner overall, after season six's Jordin Sparks, who was also seventeen when she won.[17][55] Because of his age, McCreery had to have one of his parents live with him throughout the competition; usually his mother. They lived in a mansion with the other contestants for a short time, but moved into an apartment of their own before the end of the series.[13]
