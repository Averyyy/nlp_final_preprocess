The Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team represents the University of Hawai i at M noa in NCAA Division I FBS college football.  It was part of the Western Athletic Conference until July 2012, when the team joined the Mountain West Conference.
From 2000 until July 1, 2013, the football team was renamed to simply Warriors, until a 2013 decision to standardize all of the school's athletic team names took effect, and the team was once again known as the Rainbow Warriors.[2]
The Hawai i Warriors were the third team from a non automatic qualifier conference to play in a BCS bowl game. They played Georgia in the Sugar Bowl on January 1, 2008, in New Orleans, and lost 41 10.

Significantly, large crowds (18,000 to 20,000) flock to Honolulu Stadium to watch the Rainbows for the first time in many years, setting the stage for a major gridiron revival in future years.
Dave Holmes era (1968 1973)[edit]
1968   Head coach Dave Holmes begins what would be the most successful coaching tenure at Hawai i. From 1968 1974, UH won 67 percent of its games and never suffered a losing season. Holmes still ranks as the all-time leader at Hawai i in winning percentage (.718).

In the game, the Rainbow Warriors earn their first bowl victory, a 27 17 defeat of Illinois. Hawai i would finish the season ranked 20th in the nation and post a team-record 11 victories. The 1992 Rainbows had 10 regular season victories and two future NFL veterans: defensive end Maa Tanuvasa, who played seven seasons; and place kicker Jason Elam, who played 17 seasons and was selected to three Pro Bowls. [4]
Fred von Appen era (1996 1998)[edit]
1996   Rich Ellerson extends coaching tree for former UH Warriors by being named as Head Football Coach for Southern Utah. In his single season, Ellerson accrued a 4 7 record.
1998   Hawai i suffers through the program's first-ever winless season, going 0 12 under head coach Fred von Appen. Von Appen coached the Rainbow Warriors. to a 5 31 record in his three years at Hawai i. He would be fired after the season.

Hawai i quarterback Timmy Chang would also become the NCAA's all-time leader in passing yards with 17,072 over the course of his career, eclipsing the old mark (15,031) set by former BYU quarterback Ty Detmer.
 Game between Boise State and Hawai i in 2007. Hawai i won 39 27.
2005   Hawai i finishes 5 7 and misses out on playing in a bowl game for the first time since 2001, despite a breakout year for quarterback Colt Brennan.
2006   Quarterback Colt Brennan sets NCAA single-season records for touchdown passes (58) and passer efficiency rating (185.78), on his way to a sixth-place finish in the Heisman Trophy voting. The Warriors return to the Hawai i Bowl and defeat Arizona State, 41 24. Hawai i head coach June Jones passes Dick Tomey to become the winningest head coach in school history.
2007   Brennan adds to his collection of NCAA records, breaking Detmer's career records for TD passes and total TDs passing, rushing and receiving. He and wide receiver Davone Bess also tied an NCAA record for most career TDs by a quarterback-receiver combination. The Warriors are unbeaten, with a breakthrough win against Boise State, giving the Warriors their first win ever over the Broncos as a WAC member and their first outright WAC title ever. A 35 28 win over Washington in the season finale on December 1 resulted in them finishing No. 12 in the BCS rankings and earning a berth in the Sugar Bowl. This is the first regular season Hawai i has ever gone undefeated. Hawai i was also the sole undefeated college football team for the season. Hawai i then played Georgia on January 1, 2008 in New Orleans, losing 41 10. Ken Niumatalolo extends coaching tree for former UH Warriors by being named as Head Football Coach for Navy.  Quarterback Colt Brennan was selected for the second year in a row as a Heisman Finalist, this time finishing in third place behind Tim Tebow and Darren McFadden.
Greg McMackin era (2008 2011)[edit]
2008   Head coach June Jones resigns shortly after the 2007 season, ending his nine-year coaching run to become the new head coach at Southern Methodist University. On January 15, Greg McMackin, formerly the defensive coordinator under June Jones, accepted the position of head coach. Rich Ellerson extends coaching tree for former UH Warriors by being named as head coach for Army.
2009   Jim Mills becomes the first UH Warrior to be inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame for his play as an offensive tackle in the Canadian Football League.
2010   Hawai i wins its 4th WAC Championship by becoming co-champions with Nevada and Boise State.  University of Hawai i received and accepted an invitation to join the Mountain West Conference for football only and Big West Conference for all other sports. The Warriors bolted from Western Athletic Conference to join the Mountain West Conference along with rivals; Boise State, Fresno State and Nevada. Boise State started playing in the MWC starting in 2011, while Hawai i along with Fresno State and Nevada made their MWC debuts in 2012.
2011   Coach Greg McMackin resigns as head coach citing "being forced out under pressure" from the past season's record.[5] Utah offensive coordinator Norm Chow was chosen to succeed McMackin.
Norm Chow era (2012 2015)[edit]
2012   After 13 years of the pass heavy run and shoot offense installed by former head coach June Jones, former Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator and new Hawaii head coach Norm Chow implements his more balanced pro-style offense. The Warriors go 3 9 on the season, with the only wins coming against UNLV and FCS opponents South Alabama and Lamar.
2013    Norm Chow and the Rainbow Warriors fall to 1 11, defeating only Army in the last game of the season.
2014   The season started with promise under new starter Ikaika Woolsey, but during a game versus Northern Iowa, the frustrated crowd of 20,000 was audibly booing the offense for continually running with limited passing plays. Chow described the 27 24 win as "joyless", but following a tough loss to former WAC foe Rice, the 'Bows put together the best performance of the season with a wild 38 28 win over Wyoming, capturing the Paniolo Trophy for the first time since 1992. But the team fell apart, culminating in a disheartening 28 21 loss to Fresno State following a wild 37 35 victory over UNLV. The loss salted already smashed hopes of a division title, ending the 'Bows season at 4 9.
2015   The season started out with a big win for the program over Colorado but the team slumped to 2 7 and Norm Chow was fired following a program-worst 51-point conference home loss to Air Force, 58 7, with the Falcons retaining the Kuter Trophy. Chris Naeole was named the interim head coach the Sunday following the game. Later, defensive coordinator Tom Mason was reassigned to an administrative role before the season finale. But the Rainbow Warriors fought on, winning their final game of the season and finishing with an overall record of 3 10.  On November 27, Nevada offensive coordinator and former UH Warrior Nick Rolovich took over as head coach, succeeding Naeole. The 107,145 in attendance for the game against Ohio State at the Ohio Stadium on September 12 is the second largest crowd to ever attend a University of Hawaii football game.
Nick Rolovich era (2016 2019)[edit]
2016   The 2016 college football season started with a new head coach on August 27 at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Australia, for a game between the Cal Golden Bears and the Hawai'i Rainbow Warriors, the first international football game for UH.[6] Like those before it, the season started with a 51 31 loss, further heightened by a 63 3 thrashing at the hands of national power Michigan. The 110,222 in attendance for the game against Michigan at Michigan Stadium on September 3 is the largest crowd to ever attend a University of Hawaii football game. This broke the previous record attendance, which was set in 2015. The team also saw the largest ticket attendance since 2014, 28,687 in a 41 38 loss to UNLV on Homecoming Night.
2017   The season saw Hawaii win their first two games over UMass and Western Carolina, but injuries to key players such as John Ursua lead to the Warriors losing 9 of their last 10 games of the season.
2018   Coming off a 3 9 season, head coach Nick Rolovich decides to switch from a balanced spread option offense to the pass oriented run and shoot offense. Led by redshirt sophomore quarterback Cole McDonald, Hawaii starts the season off with a 6 1 record, before proceeding to lose the next 4 games to BYU, Nevada, Fresno State, and Utah State. Hawaii becomes bowl eligible with a 35 28 win over UNLV behind backup quarterback and true freshman Chevan Cordeiro's 3 TD passes on 5 pass attempts. Hawaii loses to former WAC rival Louisiana Tech in the Hawaii Bowl by a score of 31 14.
2019   Coming of their most successful season in 8 years, Hawaii entered the season winning a 45 38 thriller against Arizona, stopping Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate 1 yard short of the end zone as time expired. Hawaii spends the season with alternating quarterback play, with Cole McDonald starting 13 games, and Chevan Cordeiro starting 2 and replacing McDonald as starter in 10 of McDonald's 13 starts. Hawaii wins their conference game against San Diego State 14 11, clinching their first division title in the history of Hawaii's play in the Mountain West Conference. Hawaii loses the Mountain West Championship to Boise State 31 10, but wins their bowl game to BYU 38 34 behind Hawaii QB Cole McDonald's 493 yards and 4 TDs. Hawaii finishes the season 10 5, their first ten win season since 2010, and just the seventh in program history. Head coach Nick Rolovich is named Mountain West Coach of the Year as a result, becoming the first coach to win it from Hawaii during their tenure in the Mountain West.
Todd Graham era (2020 2021)[edit]
2020   Coming off a ten win season and a division title, head coach Nick Rolovich suddenly departs from the program to take the head coaching position at Washington State University, taking most of his coaching staff and support staff with him. Starting quarterback Cole McDonald also departs from Hawaii, declaring for the NFL Draft. Approximately 1 week later, athletic director David Matlin announces the hire of former Arizona State head coach Todd Graham. Graham retains two assistants, Jacob Yoro and Abe Elimimian from Rolovich's staff, and hires G. J. Kinne and former Hawaii linebacker Victor Santa Cruz as offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator respectively. The Rainbow Warriors win their first game of the season against rival Fresno State, 34 19, accumulating over 300 yards of rushing and forcing four turnovers; Graham becomes the first UH head coach to win in his debut since Bob Wagner in 1987.[7] The season was also highlighted by an upset of previously undefeated Nevada, which effectively gave the Rainbow Warriors a bowl berth ahead of San Diego State and Fresno State on a tiebreaker. They capped off the year by winning the New Mexico Bowl over Houston, 28 14. The bowl victory clinched a third straight winning season and the 100th win in Graham s career.
2021   Issues with Aloha Stadium led to that venue halting the scheduling of new events as of December 2020.[8] As a result, the Rainbow Warriors announced plans to play home games on campus at the Clarence T. C. Ching Athletics Complex "for at least the next three years".[9] Despite a season that saw the team reach a program-record fourth consecutive bowl game even with a 6-7 record, an upset over Fresno State, and reclaiming the Paniolo Trophy with a 38-14 win over Wyoming in Laramie, Graham resigned after multiple reports surfaced of player mistreatment on January 14, 2022. It was also later discovered the Hawaii Bowl was only canceled because Hawaii players refused to play in the game due to injuries, COVID-19 issues, and competitive disadvantages, done by a players-only vote without Graham's knowledge.

Timmy Chang era (2022-present)[edit]
2022 - Following the resignation of Graham in January 2022, Hawaii signs former quarterback Timmy Chang to a four year deal to be head coach.[10] Jacob Yoro and Abe Elimimian were once again retained as part of the staff, but most of the rest of the staff was new, including Ian Shoemaker as offensive coordinator and quaterbacks coach. 19 players from the 2021 team transferred elsewhere in the fallout of Graham's tenure as coach, leaving the 2022 team depleted of depth. With these issues, the team struggled much of the season, recording a 3 10 record and a 2 6 record in conference.

Fresno State[edit]
Battle for the Golden Screwdriver
Main article: Fresno State Hawaii football rivalry
With the BYU rivalry losing steam after the Cougars left the WAC in 1999, the rivalry with Fresno State has increased greatly in recent years, with both teams being the oldest members of the WAC contending regularly for the conference championship.  Coaches from both schools have accused each side of various episodes of poor sportsmanship over the years, and both schools have some of the nation's rowdiest home fans. The rivalry has featured some lopsided results, including a 70 14 Fresno victory over Hawai i in 2004 and a 68 37 Warriors victory in 2006 over Fresno. In 2007, allegations that Fresno State fans were physically and verbally abused by hometown Hawai i fans circulated the internet and television media added to this rivalry.
It was being reported that several Fresno State fans attempted to warn Boise State fans from attending Hawai i football games due to potential violence against them, however no incidents were reported by Boise State fans and many photographs from Hawai i-based publications covered incidents where Hawai i and Boise State fans were seen mingling together before and after their 2007 game. The rivalry still continues to be one that is anticipated by both sides and continues to the present, with Fresno State having joined the Mountain West Conference in 2012, reuniting it with Hawai i and other former WAC members in Nevada and Boise State.
It is Hawaii's most-played rivalry series.[11] The two teams have met 55 times, with Fresno State leading the all-time series 30 24 1 through the 2022 season.[12]
Air Force[edit]
Battle for the Kuter Trophy
Main article: Air Force Hawaii football rivalry
This is one of the oldest rivalries involving Hawaii, along with the Fresno State rivalry. This rivalry is attributed to the late General Laurence S. Kuter, who was stationed on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam as commander of the Pacific Air Forces. This led to the creation of the Kuter Trophy, a symbol of sportsmanship and school pride, but also the eternal friendship between the Air Force and Hawaii. The Falcons are in possession of the trophy following a 56 26 win in Honolulu in 2019. 
The two teams have met 22 times, with Air Force leading the series 14 7 1.
Wyoming[edit]
Battle for the Paniolo Trophy

The rivalry began in 1978, when Hawaii joined the Western Athletic Conference, and was played annually until 1997, shortly before Wyoming departed from the WAC and joined the newly formed Mountain West Conference. The rivalry was renewed in 2013 when Hawaii joined the MW as a football-only affiliate member. The teams have met 26 times, with Wyoming leading the series 16 11. Wyoming and Hawaii play for the Paniolo Trophy. 'Paniolo' is a Hawaiian word meaning  cowboy ,[13] and the trophy featured a bronze cowboy on horseback, twirling a lariat. The trophy was donated to the two schools by the Wyoming Paniolo Society, a group of Hawaii residents with Wyoming roots.[14] Because the two teams could not find the original trophy, a new trophy was modeled after a statue that stands in Waimea on the Big Island at the Parker Ranch Center. Wyoming won that game in Laramie 59 56 in overtime. Before that, the last time the two schools met was in 1997 in the old Western Athletic Conference with Wyoming winning 35 6 in Honolulu. Hawaii holds the Paniolo Trophy as they won the most recent meeting, 38 14 in Laramie, their first since 1991.[when?][citation needed]
San Jose State[edit]
Dick Tomey Legacy Game
Main article: Dick Tomey Legacy Game
The two schools were each led by legendary coach Dick Tomey, who died in 2019. The winner of the rivalry game each year takes possession of the Dick Tomey Legacy Trophy. San Jose State currently holds the trophy after winning the last 3 meetings, the most recent in San Jose, California in 2022.
The two schools first met in 1936. The  Rainbow Warriors and Spartans have played each other 45 times as of the 2022 season.
As of 2022, the series is tied at 22 22 1.
UNLV[edit]
Ninth Island Showdown
Beginning in 2017, the annual game between UNLV and Hawai'i, 'Ninth Island Showdown' or, 'The Battle for the Golden Pineapple' gained a rivalry trophy when the California Hotel and Casino donated the "Golden Pineapple" to the winner of the game. Las Vegas, Nevada has long been a popular destination for Hawaiians for both pleasure and relocation, so much so that it has been dubbed "the Ninth Island", with the  Cal Hotel in particular aggressively marketing itself to Hawaiian tourists. UNLV is one of Hawaii's two protected Mountain West Conference rivalries when the conference shifts to one division in 2023, meaning they will play every year. The 'Bows lead the all-time series between the two schools 19-13 as of 2022. [15]

Future non-conference games[edit]
The NCAA permits Hawai i to play one more than the normal 12 games during the regular season to recoup its unusually high travel costs to and from the mainland.[18] The team's opponents who play at Hawai i each season are also allowed one more game than their normal limit.[19][20] This rule was modified before the 2016 season; Hawaii is now open to play before Labor Day Weekend (during FCS Kickoff Week).
The exemption was modified to avoid a 13-game schedule with no bye weeks.
Announced schedules as of October 25, 2019.[21][22]
