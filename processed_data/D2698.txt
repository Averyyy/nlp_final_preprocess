IBRIX Fusion is a parallel file system combined with a logical volume manager, availability features and a management interface.  The software was produced, sold, and supported by IBRIX Incorporated of Billerica, Massachusetts.  HP announced on July 17, 2009 that it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire IBRIX.[1]  Subsequent to the acquisition, the software components of IBRIX have been combined with ProLiant servers to form the X9000 series of storage systems.[2]
The X9000 storage systems are designed to provide network-attached storage over both standard protocols (SMB, NFS, HTTP and NDMP[2]) as well as a proprietary protocol.  Architecturally, the file system is limited to 16 petabytes under a single namespace,[3] and is based upon a design described in U.S. Patent 6,782,389.
It is used in the HPE StoreOnce (former D2D) products.[citation needed]
