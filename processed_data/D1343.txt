This is a comprehensive listing that highlights significant achievements and milestones based upon the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It spans the period from the issue dated January 1, 1955 to present. The Billboard Hot 100 began with the issue dated August 4, 1958, and is currently the standard popular music chart in the United States.
Prior to the creation of the Hot 100, Billboard published four singles charts: "Best Sellers in Stores", "Most Played by Jockeys", "Most Played in Jukeboxes" and "The Top 100". These charts, which ranged from 20 to 100 slots, were phased out at different times between 1957 and 1958. Though technically not part of the Hot 100 chart history, select data from these charts are included for computational purposes, and to avoid unenlightening or misleading characterizations.
All items listed below are from the Hot 100 era, unless otherwise noted (pre-Hot 100 charts).
All-time achievements
In 2008, for the 50th anniversary of the Hot 100, Billboard magazine compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing songs on the chart over the 50 years, along with the best-performing artists.[1][2] In 2013, Billboard revised the rankings for the chart's 55th anniversary edition.[3] In 2015, Billboard revised the rankings again.[4] In 2018, the rankings were revised again for the Billboard chart's 60th anniversary.[5] In 2021, Billboard revised the rankings again upon the ascendance of "Blinding Lights" to the top spot on the list.[6] Shown below are the top 10 songs and top 10 artists over the 63-year period of the Hot 100, through November 2021. Also shown are the artists placing the most songs on the overall "all-time" top 100 song list.

Pre-Hot 100 notes:
In 1956, Elvis Presley's "Hound Dog" / "Don't Be Cruel" was number 1 on the "Best Sellers in Stores" and "Most Played in Jukeboxes" charts for 11 weeks.
In 1955, The McGuire Sisters' "Sincerely" was number 1 on the "Most Played by Jockeys" chart for 10 weeks.
In 1955, P rez Prado's "Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White" was number 1 on the "Best Sellers in Stores" chart for 10 weeks.
Additional notes:
Before the use of Nielsen SoundScan and Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems to compile the Hot 100 in late 1991, the most number of weeks a single spent at number one on the Hot 100 was 10. This occurred twice, with Debby Boone's "You Light Up My Life" in 1977, and Olivia Newton-John's "Physical" in 1981 82. Five additional singles managed nine weeks at number one during the first 34 years of the chart (1958 1992). In October 1992, the first single to top the Hot 100 for more than 10 weeks was Boyz II Men's "End of the Road",[7] which accumulated 13 weeks at number one by November that year.

Changes in when the eligibility of a single first begins, as well as more accurate digital download totals, have made abrupt chart jumps more commonplace. From 1955 to 2001, under Billboard's previous methodologies, only two singles ascended directly to No. 1 from a previous position beneath the Top 20: The Beatles' "Can't Buy Me Love", which jumped from No. 27 to the top slot in April 1964, and Brandy and Monica's "The Boy Is Mine" which jumped from No. 23 to No. 1 in June 1998.

Under Billboard's previous methodologies, jumps of this magnitude were rare. One exception was Jeannie C. Riley's "Harper Valley PTA," which advanced 74 slots in August 1968;[53] this upward acceleration went unmatched for 30 years, but has been surpassed over a dozen times since 2006. Changes in when the eligibility of a single first begins, as well as more accurate digital download totals, have made abrupt chart jumps more commonplace.

    "Purple Rain" and "When Doves Cry" reappeared on the Hot 100 for two weeks in 2016, and the above reflects their re-entries only. When the songs originally charted in 1984, their chart positions in their final week on the Hot 100 were well below the top 10.
Prior to 2008, the biggest drop off the Hot 100 was "Nights in White Satin" by The Moody Blues, which ranked at No. 17 in its final week on the chart in December 1972. This high drop-off position was matched in January 1975 by "Junior's Farm" by Paul McCartney and Wings. The record descent held for over three decades.  Each song above dropped off the Hot 100 upon four or fewer weeks; "Nights in White Satin" and "Junior's Farm" dropped off after 18 and 12 weeks, respectively.

Holiday songs
During November and December beginning some time in the 2010s, these songs have regularly appeared on the Hot 100, generally departing from the chart once the holiday season ends in January. More recently, they have reached into the top ten, and in 2019, for only the second time ever on the Hot 100 (the first since 1958), made it to number one. This has led to all-time records for dropping off the Hot 100, including from number one, as the songs depart regardless of their final chart positions during the season. Only the highest drop-off position per song is listed and its most recent date if achieved more than once, like "All I Want for Christmas Is You", which first dropped off the Hot 100 from number one on January 11, 2020, and did so again in 2022 and 2023.

    The biggest number-one listed by each artist reflects its overall performance on the Hot 100, as calculated by Billboard, and may not necessarily be the single which spent the most weeks at No. 1 for the artist, such as Madonna's "Like a Virgin" (six weeks at No. 1, compared to seven for "Take a Bow"), Mariah Carey's "We Belong Together" (fourteen weeks at No. 1, compared to sixteen for her duet with Boyz II Men, "One Sweet Day"), Janet Jackson's "Miss You Much" (four weeks at No. 1, compared to eight for "That's the Way Love Goes") and Michael Jackson's duet with Paul McCartney, "Say Say Say" (six weeks at No. 1, compared to seven for both his solo singles "Billie Jean" and "Black or White").
    Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100.
Billboard now credits the dual No. 1 Presley single "Don't Be Cruel"/"Hound Dog" as a single chart entity, and credits Presley with 17 number one singles.[114] "Don't Be Cruel"/"Hound Dog" spent 11 weeks at No. 1, "Hound Dog" for 6 weeks, "Don't Be Cruel" for 5 weeks. Many chart statisticians however, such as Joel Whitburn, still list Presley as having 18 number ones.
If counting Drake's uncredited feature on Travis Scott's "Sicko Mode", then he would be listed with 12 total number ones.

    Pre-Hot 100 charts and Hot 100. Presley is sometimes credited with an "80th week" that occurred when "All Shook Up" spent a ninth week on top of the "Most Played in Jukeboxes" chart. Although Billboard's chart statistician Joel Whitburn still counts this 80th week based on preexisting research, Billboard magazine itself has since revised its methodology and officially credits Presley with 79 weeks.[114] Much of Presley's total factors in pre-Hot 100 data. If counting from the August 1958 Hot 100 inception, Presley totaled 22 weeks at No. 1.
Note: For singer Fergie, if Black Eyed Peas is included, this would put Fergie on the list with 34 weeks at No. 1.
Note: For singer Michael Jackson, if The Jackson 5, which would also be later known as The Jacksons, is included, this would give Michael Jackson 47 cumulative weeks at No. 1.[116]
Note: For singer Beyonc , if Destiny's Child is included, this would give Beyonc  61 cumulative weeks at No. 1.[116]
Note: For singer Diana Ross, if The Supremes are included, this would give Diana Ross 42 cumulative weeks at No. 1.
Note: For each of the Beatles:[116]
If John Lennon's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give John Lennon 65 cumulative weeks at No. 1.
If Paul McCartney's total weeks were to include the Beatles, as well as Wings, this would give Paul McCartney 89 cumulative weeks at No. 1.
If George Harrison's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give George Harrison 65 cumulative weeks at No. 1.
If Ringo Starr's total weeks were to include the Beatles, this would give Ringo Starr 61 cumulative weeks at No. 1.
Note: For rapper Drake, if the track "Sicko Mode" is included, this would give him 55 weeks at No. 1.

"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" (August 17, 2011)
"The One That Got Away" (No. 3   January 7, 2012)
Houston's "Thinking About You" is not counted as interrupting  the streak, as it never appeared on the Hot 100, due to not being released to Pop radio. Likewise, Perry's "Not Like the Movies" and "Circle the Drain" were only promotional singles, not radio singles.
With the streak spanning from her debut single "Vision of Love" until "Emotions," Mariah Carey became the first artist in Hot 100 history to have their first 5 solo singles reach No. 1 on the chart.

Saturday Night Fever generated number-one singles for two different artists: "How Deep Is Your Love", "Stayin' Alive" and "Night Fever" by the Bee Gees; and "If I Can't Have You" by Yvonne Elliman. A Fifth Of Beethoven by Walter Murphy, You Should Be Dancing and Jive Talkin' by the Bee Gees all reached No. 1 but are from earlier albums, so these aren't generated from "Saturday Night Fever".
Katy Perry's Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was a reissue of the Teenage Dream album, and featured an additional single, "Part of Me", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. This brings her actual total to six. However, this does not count since the single comes from a reissue of the album and not the original release.[185]

The No. 1 song with the longest title contains 41 words and topped the charts for Stars on 45 in June 1981. Though DJs announced it as the Stars on 45 Medley, its official title is "Medley: Intro 'Venus' / Sugar Sugar / No Reply / I'll Be Back / Drive My Car / Do You Want to Know a Secret / We Can Work It Out / I Should Have Known Better / Nowhere Man / You're Going to Lose That Girl / Stars on 45."
The No. 1 song in the first week Billboard incorporated sales and airplay data from Nielsen SoundScan and Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems was "Set Adrift on Memory Bliss" by P.M. Dawn (November 30, 1991).[214]
On September 2, 1995, "You Are Not Alone" by Michael Jackson became the first song to debut at No. 1. The rest of that year saw three additional number-one debuts, including two by Mariah Carey. The four number-one debuts in 1995 would hold as the most in one calendar year until 2018, when it was matched. This record was topped in 2020, when 12 songs debuted at number one.[215] A total of 66 number-one debuts have occurred through the chart dated April 8, 2023.[141]
The No. 1 song in the first week Billboard allowed songs without a commercial single release to chart on the Hot 100 was "I'm Your Angel" by R. Kelly and C line Dion (December 5, 1998). Though the song was making its first appearance on the Hot 100 that week, Billboard did not consider it a debut at No. 1, since it appeared on unpublished test charts prior to the allowance of airplay-only songs on the main chart.[216] "I'm Your Angel" also entered the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart that week at No. 1,[217] so it would have been ineligible to chart on the Hot 100 before then.
The first "airplay-only" song to reach No. 1 (no points from a commercial single release) was "Try Again" by Aaliyah (June 17, 2000).[218]
"We Don't Talk About Bruno", by Carolina Gait n, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz, and the cast of Encanto, set the record for the most credited artists on a No. 1 song (February 5, 2022).[219]
Morgan Wallen holds the record for the most entries in the Hot 100 during a one-week period, with 36 on the March 18, 2023 chart. The Beatles had long held this record, occupying 14 positions on the Hot 100 dated April 11, 1964, a feat unmatched for nearly 51 years. On March 7, 2015, Drake tied the Beatles mark,[220] and he equaled it again on October 17 that year.[192] Justin Bieber then reset the record to 17 on December 5, 2015,[221] before Drake reclaimed the record with 20 on May 21, 2016, broke his own record with 24 on the April 8, 2017 chart, and broke it again with 27 on July 14, 2018.[192][222]
The Beatles are the only artists to simultaneously hold the top 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 albums chart. They achieved this feat for nine consecutive weeks, from February 29, 1964, to April 25, 1964. For the first five weeks of that run, through March 28, 1964, "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and "She Loves You" were the No. 1 and No. 2 singles (which swapped positions during March 1964), while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles held the top 2 spots on the albums charts. For the remaining weeks of the run, "Can't Buy Me Love" and their cover of "Twist and Shout" were the No. 1 and No. 2 singles, while Meet the Beatles! and Introducing... The Beatles continued their reign as the top 2 albums.[223][224]
On February 23, 2019, Ariana Grande became the first act since the Beatles and first solo artist to simultaneously occupy the top three.[166]
Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ariana Grande, Drake, and Taylor Swift hold the record of writing all of the top-three singles for one week. The Gibbs co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 18, 1978   No. 1 "Night Fever" and No. 2 "Stayin' Alive" for the Bee Gees, and No. 3 "Emotion" for Samantha Sang.[208] Lennon and McCartney co-wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 14, 1964   No. 1 "I Want to Hold Your Hand", No. 2 "She Loves You", and No. 3 "Please Please Me", all for The Beatles.[225] They continued this record the following week of March 21, 1964, when "She Loves You" switched places with "I Want to Hold Your Hand".[165][226] Grande wrote the top 3 singles for the week of February 23, 2019   No. 1 "7 Rings", No. 2 "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored", and No. 3 "Thank U, Next", all for herself.[227] Drake wrote the top 3 singles for the week of March 20, 2021, and the top 5 singles for the week of September 18, 2021, both times all for himself. Swift wrote the entire top 10 songs for the week of November 5, 2022.[228]
Justin Bieber is the first artist in history to achieve new No. 1 songs in consecutive weeks on the Hot 100. On the chart dated May 27, 2017, Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee's "Despacito" dethroned DJ Khaled's "I'm the One" which debuted at No. 1 a week prior, both songs on which he is a featured artist.[229]
The Black Eyed Peas hold the record for the longest uninterrupted time at No. 1 on the Hot 100, a total of 26 consecutive weeks from April to October 2009. "Boom Boom Pow" spent the first 12 weeks on top, with "I Gotta Feeling" taking over for the remaining 14 weeks.[230] Prior to August 2009, Usher held this record, spending 19 consecutive weeks on top of the chart in 2004 with "Yeah!" (12 weeks at No. 1) and "Burn" (first 7 of its 8 total weeks at No. 1).[231]
On December 4, 2010, Rihanna's "Only Girl (In the World)" reached the top spot two weeks after "What's My Name?", becoming the first time in Hot 100 history that an album's lead single hit No. 1 after the second single did.[232]
On the chart dated January 28, 2017, Ed Sheeran became the first artist to debut more than one song in the top 10 for the same week: "Shape of You" debuted at No. 1, while "Castle on the Hill" entered at No. 6.[233]
Justin Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the Hot 100, following the release of his debut seven-track EP My World on December 5, 2009.[234]
Drake is the first artist to have a number-one debut replace another number-one debut. He did this April 21, 2018, when "Nice For What" replaced "God's Plan" at the summit, after the latter had spent eleven weeks on top.[235]

All three of Blood, Sweat & Tears' No. 2 singles were released consecutively, making them the only act to achieve this feat.
Taylor Swift is the first act to simultaneously debut two songs in the top-four and three songs in the top-six of the chart. She achieved it when "Cardigan", "The 1" and "Exile", debuted at numbers one, four and six, respectively, on the chart dated August 8, 2020.[240]
Ariana Grande is the first artist in history to debut three songs at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in a single calendar year. "Stuck With U", "Rain On Me", and "Positions" all debuted at number one in 2020.[241]
Taylor Swift is the first act in history to simultaneously debut at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot 100 charts. She achieved it when her eighth studio album, Folklore, debuted atop the Billboard 200 in the same week as its lead single "Cardigan" debuted atop the Hot 100, on the charts dated August 8, 2020.[242] She is also the first act in history to achieve the said record a total of four times. Her second time was with her ninth studio album, Evermore, and its lead single "Willow" (December 26, 2020);[215] the third with Red (Taylor's Version) and "All Too Well (Taylor's Version)" (November 27, 2021);[140] and the fourth with Midnights and its lead single, "Anti-Hero" (November 5, 2022).[133]

(Debuting at number four was "Leave the Door Open" by Silk Sonic).[244] On September 18, 2021, this record was broken when the top five songs were all Hot 100 debuts; all five were by Drake ("Way 2 Sexy", "Girls Want Girls", "Fair Trade", "Champagne Poetry", and "Knife Talk").[citation needed]
