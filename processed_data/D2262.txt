Olivia is a children's computer-animated comedy television series produced by media company Chorion and based on Ian Falconer's books, after its first live-action TV series, The Olivia Squared TV Show. The series won a silver Parents' Choice Award for its positive storylines and characters.[1] The series premiered on January 26, 2009 on the Nick Jr. Channel and aired episodes through October 29, 2015. 40 episodes were produced.[2]
In 2012, Classic Media would acquire the rights to the show from Chorion.[3] Since then, Classic Media was sold to DreamWorks Animation and became DreamWorks Classics.[4][5] In 2016, DreamWorks Animation became a subsidiary of NBCUniversal.[6]
Plot[edit]
Taking place in a world where all characters are pigs, Olivia revolves around the title character and her family. The plots are mostly everyday situations in which Olivia finds herself and her unique way of dealing with them. In almost every episode from season 1, Olivia also dispenses her "Rules of Life". In each episode, Olivia dreams of having a job from the episode's experiences, such as being an artist after visiting the art gallery or being her mum's assistant after helping plan her friend's birthday party. Olivia sings the goodnight song at the end of each episode in Season 2 of Olivia.

Characters[edit]
Olivia (voiced by Emily Gray) is a young pig and the main character of the show. She is imaginative and fantasizes about different roles, such as a pop star or superhero. She displays good behavior and shows kids how to share, use their imaginations, be physically active, and be self-confident. She is in 1st grade.[7]
Olivia's family[edit]
Ian (voiced by Michael Van Citters) is Olivia's younger brother. He looks up to Olivia and enjoys being included in her activities, but often becomes the typical annoying "little bother". He likes, among other things, dinosaurs, robots and baseball. In Season 2, he becomes less annoying, is more intelligent, on better terms with his sister, has a small planet on his T-shirt and a deeper voice.[8]
William (voiced by Robert Toonitititusa) is Olivia and Ian's baby brother and typically sleeps, eats, and cries.[8]
Mum, Olivia's mother (voiced by Joyce Beverley (Season 1) Jennifer Reiter (Season 2)), who runs her own party-planning business from home.[8]
Dad, Olivia's father (voiced by Danny Katiana) is an architect and occasionally absent-minded. He often provides his paternal wisdom to Olivia and her brothers in "little talks".[8]
Grandma, Olivia's grandmother (voiced by Yvonne Craig). In her late-fifties, but still fun and adventurous.[8]
Uncle Garrett (voiced by Connor Hall), Olivia's maternal uncle, is a professional football player and is a bit of a comedian. He performs ballet with Olivia and only appears in "Olivia Takes Ballet".
Grandpa Cedric, Olivia's unseen grandfather that Olivia mentions in "Olivia's Day at the Office".
Perry and Edwin, Olivia's dog and cat. Perry is energetic and loves to play with the children, while Edwin is generally lethargic and prefers to sleep.[8]
Goldfish, a goldfish whose owner is Ian. It is rarely seen.
Cedric, a one-time frog that Ian found and named after his Grandpa.
Friends[edit]
Julian (voiced by Jeremy Herzig) is Olivia's male best friend. He's smart with a self-deprecating sense of humor, but shy and lets Olivia take the lead. While often reluctant to go along with Olivia's ideas, he finally always does.[8]
Francine (voiced by Brianna McCracken (Season 1) and Josie Baker (Season 2)) is Olivia's female best friend. In the first season, she can be snobby, villainous, tries to make Olivia feel jealous at times, and often serves as the antagonist. She acts more "girly" than Olivia and will not touch anything gross. Her birthday is eight months after Olivia's. In Season 2, Francine gets better and friendly to Olivia and her classmates.
Gwendolyn is Francine's yellowish orange tabby. She is very talented and likes Edwin. In one episode, Francine reveals that she sometimes dresses her in Barbie Fashions to have a tea party and makes Gwendolyn fish sticks.
Herman is Francine's dog. He makes his only appearance in "Olivia Trains Her Cat". He can ride a skateboard and also knows tricks like Gwendolyn.
School[edit]
Mrs. Hogenmuller (voiced by Susan Balboni), Olivia's teacher, is a dedicated educator, if a bit eccentric. She is an avid cat fancier and cowbell-playing virtuoso, with a penchant for the outdoors and a great enthusiasm for learning and life. She has 3 pets: two cats and a turkey.
Alexandra (voiced by Zarii Arri) is Olivia's classmate and a girl. She often agrees only along with Francine.
Sam (voiced by John Mumelo), a classmate. He rarely talks. He has a pet opossum named Sally.
Harold Hockenberri (voiced by Dayton Malone), a classmate. Harold is allergic to parsley, wears glasses, and his mum hates frogs. He can juggle but hiccups when nervous. He has a parrot that says things such as "Hi there," three times.
Oscar and Otto, identical twin classmates whose recurring catchphrase is, "It's cool."
Daisy (voiced by Katie Leigh), a small classmate who wears an all-purple-attire. In Season 1, she is a nice girl. In Season 2, she replaces Francine as a troublemaker.
Connor (voiced by Alicyn Packard), a classmate who looks like Sam but talks more.
Olivia 2 (voiced by Mary Smith), a character that made her only appearance in the episode "The Two Olivias". Olivia was a new student in Olivia's class, much to the original Olivia's annoyance. They reconcile having the same name at the end of the episode. Olivia 2 was never seen in the episodes after it, presuming that her family moved out after a short time.
Sophie, a girl who wears a yellow T-shirt and thin light purple jumper. In Season 1, she had no name, but in "Olivia's Tip-Top Tapper", the girl's name was revealed as Sophie.  She and Sam rarely speak.
Caitlin, who wears a blue shirt with white polka-dots. She is rarely spoken like Sam and Sophie.
