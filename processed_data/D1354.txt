Criticism[edit]
On July 29, 2004, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced a consent order and judgment that would significantly reform the company's sales practices and provide restitution to consumers.  The judgment permanently enjoined the company from engaging in deceptive, fraudulent or illegal business practices, and requires the company to make substantial reforms to its sales practices and customer service operations. The judgment also requires the company to make restitution to consumers for its failure to replace or repair defective goods. In addition, the company agreed to pay $275,000 in penalties, and $2,000 in costs.[10]
The company received a grade "F" from the Better Business Bureau each year from 2006 through 2009[11] and a grade "A" in 2013.[12] Across the U.S. the company has had complaints for deceptive sales practices, delivery problems, not honoring its warranties and bait-and-switch techniques. Customer complaints are regularly ignored and lawsuits frequently follow.[13]

The large and unsecured creditors included Haining Mengnu; Ashley, with a $1.4 million claim, Klaussner, and former manufacturer Stratford/Caye.[9]
Upon emergence from Chapter 11 in February 2011 the Chinese supplier and creditor Haining Mengnu Group received about 90% of the company's new stock. The new management team included CEO Gebing (Morris) Zou, while Mr. Abada continued as president.
