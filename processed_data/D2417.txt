History[edit]
 Coat of arms of Los Altos, carved in stone on the grave of heroes in the Cemetery
In Pre-Columbian times Quetzaltenango was a city of the Mam Maya people called Xelaj , although by the time of the Spanish Conquest it had become part of the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj[citation needed]. The name may be derived from xe laju' noj meaning "under ten mountains". The city was said to have already been over 300 years old when the Spanish first arrived. With the help of his allies, Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado defeated and killed the Maya ruler Tec n Um n here[citation needed].
When Alvarado conquered the city for Spain in the 1520s, he called it by the Nahuatl name used by his Central Mexican Indian allies, "Quetzaltenango", generally considered to mean "the place of the quetzal bird." Quetzaltenango became the city's official name in colonial times[citation needed]. However, many people (especially the indigenous population) continue to call the city "Xelaj " or more commonly "Xela" for short, and some proudly, but unofficially, consider it the "capital of the Mayas".[3] Quetzaltenango central park c. 1894
From 1838 to 1840 Quetzaltenango was the capital of the state of Los Altos, one of the states or provinces of the Federal Republic of Central America. As the union broke up, the army of  Rafael Carrera conquered Quetzaltenango making it part of Guatemala. In 1850, the city had a population of approximately 20,000.[4]
During the 19th century, coffee was introduced as a major crop in the area. As a result, the economy of Xela prospered[citation needed]. Much fine Belle  poque architecture can still be found in the city.[citation needed]
On October 24, 1902, at 5:00 pm, the Santa Mar a Volcano erupted. Rocks and ash fell on Quetzaltenango at 6 PM, only one hour after the eruption.[citation needed]
In the 1920s, a young Romani woman named Vanushka Cardena Barajas died and was buried in the Xela city cemetery. An active legend has developed around her tomb that says those who bring flowers or write a request on her tomb will be reunited with their former romantic partners. The Guatemalan songwriter Alvaro Aguilar wrote a song based on this legend.[citation needed]
In 1930 the only electric railway in Guatemala, the Ferrocarril de Los Altos, was inaugurated. It was built by AEG and Krupp and had 14 train cars. The track connected Quetzaltenango with San Felipe, Retalhuleu. It was soon destroyed by mudslides and finally demolished in 1933. The people of Quetzaltenango are still very proud of the railway. A railway museum has been established in the city center.[citation needed]
Since the late 1990s Quetzaltenango has been having an economic boom, which makes it the city with the second-highest contribution to the Guatemalan economy[citation needed]. With its first high-rise buildings being built, it is expected by 2015[needs update] to have a more prominent skyline, with buildings up to 15 floors tall.
In 2008, the Central American Congress PARLACEN announced that every September 15, Quetzaltenango will be Central America's capital of culture.[5]
Quetzaltenango was supposed to host  2018 Central American and Caribbean Games but dropped out due to a lack of funding for the event.[6]
In March 2022, indigenous activists began blockading the central waste deposit near Valle de Palajunoj to protest a  city development plan enacted by the municipal authorities in June 2017.[7]

Economy[edit]
Historically, the city produced wheat, maize, fruits, and vegetables. It also had a healthy livestock industry. Livestock was exported throughout the country and to El Salvador. As of 1850, wheat was the largest export, followed by cacao, sugar, wool and cotton.[4]
Sports[edit]
Quetzaltenango is home to the Club Xelaj  MC soccer team. The team competes at Estadio Mario Camposeco which has a capacity of 13,500 and is the most successful non-capital team in the Liga Nacional de F tbol de Guatemala.[9]
Due to the city's high altitude many athletes have prepared themselves here such as Olympic silver medalist Erick Barrondo and the 2004 Cuban volleyball team.[citation needed]
The swimming team has enjoyed success in national and international events.[citation needed]
Quetzaltenango withdrew from hosting the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games. It planned to build a 30,000-seat stadium by 2016, as well seven new facilities for indoor sports and aquatics.[10]
Transportation[edit]
 The Cuatro Caminos intersection is outside the city.
The city has a system of micro-buses for quick and cheap movement. A micro-bus is essentially a large van stuffed with seats. Micro-buses are numbered based on the route they take (e.g., "Ruta 7"). There is no government-run mass transport system in the city. The sole public means of transport is the bus or micro-buses. Transportation to other cities is provided by bus. Bicycling is a way to get around and to travel to (and in) rural areas. Quetzaltenango Airport provides air service to the city.
