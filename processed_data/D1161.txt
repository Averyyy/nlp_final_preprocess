Zachary Michael Thomas (born September 1, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a middle linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons.  He played college football for Texas Tech University, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American.  He was drafted in the fifth round, 22nd pick (154th overall), in the 1996 NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins, and played for the Dolphins in his first 12 seasons in the NFL, before playing his 13th and final season with the Dallas Cowboys.
While despite his small undersized stature, limited speed, and lack of athletic ability (according to pro scouts), Zach Thomas made up with his habitual excessive study habits, always being well prepared, uncanny intelligence, versatility, and instincts as a linebacker, and his prone leadership. In his rookie year in 1996, Thomas was voted the Dolphins Team Newcomer of the Year, and also won his first of two Dolphins Team MVP awards (1996, 2001). He was also named the AFC  Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1996. Thomas was also the first Dolphins player to win the Dolphins Team Leadership Award (voted by his teammates) a record three times (1998-1999, 2005), until Jason Taylor surpassed him with four (2002, 2006-2007, 2009). [1]
From 1998-2006, Thomas led a defensive unit that finished top 10 in total defense in seven consecutive seasons (1998-2004), and in eight out of nine (2006). In five of those nine seasons (1998, 2000, 2002-2003, 2006), Thomas' defenses finished top five in total scoring defense, including 1st overall in 1998.[2][3]
Thomas is also known for his longevity with the Dolphins, and currently is 2nd all time in Dolphins history for most games played by a defensive player in the team's history with 168, behind Taylor's 204.[4] A seven-time Pro Bowl selection (the most ever by a Dolphins defensive player), and seven-time first (5) or second (2) team All-Pro, Thomas recorded more than 1,700 combined tackles in his career which included leading the league in tackles twice (2002, 2006),[5] topping at least 100 combined tackles in 10 out of his 12 seasons (he topped 150+ tackles six times) with the Dolphins, and currently ranks 5th on the NFL's all-time career tackles list. He was named a two-time NFL Alumni Linebacker of the Year (1998, 2006), and was also selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team. 
In 2015, Thomas was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. On February 9th, 2023 in his 10th year of eligibility and in his 4th straight year being a finalist, Zach Thomas was elected as a member to the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2023, and is set to be formally enshrined on August 5th. [6]
Early years[edit]
Thomas was born in Pampa, Texas.  He attended White Deer Schools in White Deer, Texas until he was a sophomore then transferred to Pampa High School in his junior year.  He was a standout high school football player and was named a first-team all-state selection as a senior.  Thomas and his older brother, Bart, were high school teammates at White Deer High School in White Deer, Texas; in 1988, Thomas' freshman year, the White Deer team went 16 0 and won the Class 1A state championship.
College career[edit]
Thomas attended Texas Tech University, where he was a three-year starter at linebacker for the Texas Tech Red Raider football team.  As a junior in 1994, he was a second-team All-American.  As a senior in 1995, he was a unanimous first-team All-American, the Big 12 Conference Defensive Player of the Year, and a finalist for the Butkus Award. Thomas is one of 5 Red Raiders to be named a Unanimous All-American along with Mark Bounds, Byron Hanspard, Michael Crabtree, and Jace Amaro.[7] He recorded 390 tackles, including a career-high 131 tackles and a school-record 20 tackles against  Georgia in his senior season.[8] Thomas and his brother Bart were the only pair of brothers to be named first-team All-Southwest Conference selections in the same year.

Thomas attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, but had a performance that was described as lousy and included a 28.5" vertical jump.[11] Miami Dolphins' special teams coordinator, Mike Westhoff, was sent to Texas by the Dolphins to meet with Thomas and scout him for their special teams unit.[12] Thomas was considered to be too small and not fast or athletic enough to play at the professional level according to scouts and draft experts.[13]
Miami Dolphins[edit]
The Miami Dolphins selected Thomas in the fifth round (154th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft.[14] Thomas was the 18th linebacker drafted in a linebacker class that included Ray Lewis, Tedy Bruschi, Donnie Edwards, and Kevin Hardy.[15] Thomas was the second linebacker the Dolphins drafted in 1996, joining their fourth round pick Baylor linebacker LaCurtis Jones (126th overall).[13] Thomas was initially drafted to join special teams after the Miami Dolphins' special teams coordinator Mike Westhoff recommended him to head coach Jimmy Johnson.[12]
 Zach Thomas during his tenure with the Dolphins
The bottom line is that Zach Thomas was making plays. He has quickness, he's an instinctive player, and he makes plays ... Jack Del Rio would still be here and still be our starter were it not for the play of Zach Thomas.
 Jimmy Johnson (1996)

On July 3, 1996, the Miami Dolphins signed Thomas to a three-year, $577,000 contract at the league minimum.[16] He impressed the Dolphins' coaching staff during training camp and quickly rose up the depth chart to compete for the job as the starting middle linebacker against Jack Del Rio.

On February 23, 2008, the Dallas Cowboys signed Thomas to a one-year, $3 million contract that included a signing bonus of $1 million.[71] The signing of Thomas surprised media and observers, considering that he didn't have the previous experience or the size to play in the Cowboys 3-4 defense. After he joined the roster, the Cowboys traded linebacker Akin Ayodele to the Miami Dolphins to clear space for Thomas to become a starter at inside linebacker.[72] Thomas started alongside Bradie James and outside linebackers DeMarcus Ware and Greg Ellis.[73] In Week 4, he collected a season-high 12 combined tackles (six solo) during the Cowboys' 26 24 loss to the Washington Redskins.[74] He finished the season with 94 combined tackles (65 solo), three pass deflections, and a sack in 16 games and 14 starts.[44]
