A disaster is a serious problem occurring over a short or long period of time that causes widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.[1][2] Disasters are routinely divided into either "natural disasters" caused by natural hazards or "human-instigated disasters" caused from anthropogenic hazards. However, in modern times, the divide between natural, human-made and human-accelerated disasters is difficult to draw.[3][4][5]
Examples of natural hazards include avalanches, flooding, cold waves and heat waves, droughts, earthquakes, cyclones, landslides, lightning, tsunamis, volcanic activity, wildfires, and winter precipitation.[6] Examples of anthropogenic hazards include criminality, civil disorder, terrorism, war, industrial hazards, engineering hazards, power outages, fire, hazards caused by transportation, and environmental hazards.
Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits  more than 95% of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of gross domestic product) in developing countries than in industrialized countries.[7][8]
Etymology[edit]
The word disaster is derived from Middle French d sastre and that from Old Italian disastrocode: ita promoted to code: it , which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek pejorative prefix  - (dus-) "bad"[9] and   (aster), "star".[10] The root of the word disaster ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an astrological sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.[11]
Classification[edit]

Disasters are routinely divided into natural or human-made. However, in modern times, the divide between natural, man-made and man-accelerated disasters is quite difficult to draw.[3][4][5]
Complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in developing countries. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an earthquake that causes a tsunami, resulting in coastal flooding, resulting in damage to a nuclear power plant (such as the Fukushima nuclear disaster). Some manufactured disasters have been wrongly ascribed to nature, such as smog and acid rain.[12]
Some researchers also differentiate between recurring events, such as seasonal flooding, and those considered unpredictable.[13]
Natural disasters (caused by natural hazards)[edit]
This section is an excerpt from Natural disaster.[edit]
 Global multihazard proportional economic loss by natural disasters as cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods, landslides and volcanoes
A natural disaster is "the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community".[14] A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property,[15] and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake. The severity of the damage depends on the affected population's resilience and on the infrastructure available.[16] Examples of natural hazards include: avalanche, coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, earthquake, hail, heat wave, hurricane (tropical cyclone), ice storm, landslide, lightning, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, typhoon, tsunami, volcanic activity, wildfire, winter weather.[14]
In modern times, the divide between natural, human-made and human-accelerated disasters is quite difficult to draw.[17][18][19] Human choices and activities like architecture,[20] fire,[21][22] resource management[22][23] and climate change[24] potentially play a role in causing "natural disasters". In fact, the term "natural disaster" has been called a misnomer already in 1976.[25] A disaster is a result of a natural or human-made hazard impacting a vulnerable community. It is the combination of the hazard along with exposure of a vulnerable society that results in a disaster. 
Natural disasters can be aggravated by inadequate building norms, marginalization of people, inequities, overexploitation of resources, extreme urban sprawl and climate change.[17] The rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. Extreme climates (such as those in the Tropics) and unstable landforms, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation and non-engineered constructions  create more vulnerable interfaces of populated areas with disaster-prone natural spaces. Developing countries which suffer from chronic natural disasters, often have ineffective communication systems combined with insufficient support for disaster prevention and management.[26]

Human-instigated disasters (caused by anthropogenic hazards)[edit]
Main article: Anthropogenic hazard
 Airplane crashes and terrorist attacks are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the September 11 attacks in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York City.
Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Examples include war, social unrest, stampedes, fires, transport accidents, industrial accidents, conflicts, oil spills, terrorist attacks, and nuclear explosions/nuclear radiation.[27]
Other types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic climate change, nuclear war, and bioterrorism.[citation needed]
One opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate emergency management measures.[28]
Famines may be caused locally by drought, flood, fire, or pestilence, but in modern times there is plenty of food globally, and sustained localized shortages are generally due to government mismanagement, violent conflict, or an economic system that does not distribute food where needed. Earthquakes are mainly hazardous because of human-created buildings and dams; avoiding earthquake-generated tsunamis and landslides is largely a matter of location.[citation needed]
Responses[edit]
The following table categorizes some disasters and notes first response initiatives.[29]
Natural
Disaster
Example
Profile
First response
Avalanche
The sudden, drastic flow of snow down a slope, occurring when either natural triggers, such as loading from new snow or rain, or artificial triggers, such as explosives or backcountry skiers, overload the snowpack
Shut off utilities; Evacuate building if necessary; Determine impact on the equipment and facilities and any disruption
Blizzard
A severe snowstorm characterized by very strong winds and low temperatures
Power off all equipment; listen to blizzard advisories; Evacuate area, if unsafe; Assess damage
Earthquake
The shaking of the earth's crust, caused by underground volcanic forces of breaking and shifting rock beneath the earth's surface
Shut off utilities; Evacuate building if necessary; Determine impact on the equipment and facilities and any disruption
Fire (wild)
Fires that originate in uninhabited areas and which pose the risk to spread to inhabited areas
Attempt to suppress fire in early stages; Evacuate personnel on alarm, as necessary; Notify fire department; Shut off utilities; Monitor weather advisories
Flood
Flash flooding: Small creeks, gullies, dry streambeds, ravines, culverts or even low-lying areas flood quickly
Monitor flood advisories; Determine flood potential to facilities; Pre-stage emergency power generating equipment; Assess damage
Freezing rain
Rain occurring when outside surface temperature is below freezing
Monitor weather advisories; arrange for snow and ice removal
Heat wave
A prolonged period of excessively hot weather relative to the usual weather pattern of an area and relative to normal temperatures for the season
Listen to weather advisories; Power-off all servers after a graceful shutdown if there is imminent potential of power failure; Shut down main electric circuit usually located in the basement or the first floor
