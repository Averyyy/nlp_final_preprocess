Early life[edit]

Born in Selma, Alabama, Hamm was the fourth of six children of Bill and Stephanie Hamm.[12] She wore corrective shoes as a toddler after being born with a club foot.[13] Hamm spent her childhood on various United States Air Force bases around the world with her family. While living in Florence, Italy, Hamm first played soccer, which was hugely popular there; her entire family quickly became involved in the sport.[14] At age five, then living in Wichita Falls, Texas, Hamm joined her first soccer team. Her father coached Mia and her newly adopted brother, 8-year-old Garrett.[12]
Hamm played sports from a young age and excelled as a football player on the boys' team at junior high school. As a high school freshman and sophomore, she played soccer for Notre Dame Catholic High School in Wichita Falls. She played at the 1987 U.S. Olympic Festival, the youngest player to play for the United States women's national soccer team. As a new player, she often started as a forward but did not score a goal during her first year on the team.[15] Hamm spent a year at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia, and helped the Lake Braddock soccer team win the 1989 state championships.[16]
Club career[edit]
North Carolina Tar Heels, 1989 1993[edit]
From 1989 to 1993, Hamm attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she helped the Tar Heels win four NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championships in five years.

In 2001, Hamm was a founding player in the first professional women's soccer league in the United States, the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), and played for the Washington Freedom from 2001 to 2003.[23] Throughout the league's history, Hamm was hailed as the star of the league and used heavily in marketing and promotion. In a poll of 1,000 advertising executives conducted in 2001, she was voted "the most appealing female athlete", garnering almost twice as many votes as the runner-up Anna Kournikova.[24]
During the league's inaugural match between the Freedom and Bay Area CyberRays at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Hamm was fouled in the penalty area resulting in a penalty kick that her teammate Pretinha converted to mark the first goal scored in the league. The Freedom won 1 0.[25] In addition to the 34,148 fans in attendance being greater than any MLS game that weekend, the Turner Network Television (TNT) broadcast reached 393,087 households: more than two MLS games broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2.[26] Playing as a midfielder and forward, Hamm played in 19 of the Freedom's 21 matches during the 2001 season.[27] She led the team in goals (6) and assists (4).[27]
The Freedom finished in seventh place during the regular season with a 6 12 3 record.[27]
Hamm suffered a knee injury in November 2001 that kept her off the pitch for several months of early 2002.[28][29] Despite playing only half the 2002 season with the Freedom, she finished the season with eight goals.[28]  The team finished in third place during the 2002 season with a 11 5 5 record and advanced to the playoffs.[30] After winning the semi-final against the Philadelphia Charge 1 0, the team was defeated 3 2 by the Carolina Courage in the 2002 WUSA Founders Cup.[4] Hamm scored the Freedom's second goal in the 64th minute.[31]

Honors and awards[edit]
"My coach said I ran like a girl, I said if he could run a little faster he could too."
 Mia Hamm[161]
Hamm was named Sportswoman of the Year by the Women's Sports Foundation in 1997 and 1999.[162]  In June 1999, Nike named the largest building on their corporate campus after Hamm.[163] In December 2000, Hamm was named one of the top three female soccer players of the twentieth century in the FIFA Female Player of the Century Award, finishing behind only Sun Wen and compatriot Michelle Akers.[164]
While at North Carolina, she won the Honda Sports Award as the nation's top female soccer player in both 1993 and 1994, and won the Honda-Broderick Cup in 1994 as the nation's top female athlete.[165][166]
In March 2004, Hamm and former U.S. teammate Michelle Akers were the only two women and Americans named to the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living soccer players, selected by Pel  and commissioned by FIFA for the organization's 100th anniversary.[167] Other accolades include being elected U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year five years in a row from 1994 to 1998,[168] and winning three ESPY awards including Soccer Player of the Year and Female Athlete of the Year.[11]
In 2006 Hamm was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, followed by the Texas Sports Hall of Fame on March 11, 2008.[169][170] In 2007, during her first year of eligibility, Hamm was selected for induction into the National Soccer Hall of Fame. In 2008, an image of her silhouette was used in the logo for the second professional women's soccer league in the United States: Women's Professional Soccer.[171] ESPN named her the greatest female athlete in 2012.[172]
In 2013, Hamm became the first woman inducted into the World Football Hall of Fame, located in Pachuca, Mexico.[173] She was named to U.S. Soccer's USWNT All-Time Best XI in December 2013.[174] In 2014, Hamm was named one of ESPNW's Impact 25;[175] she was also the recipient of the Golden Foot Legends Award.[176]
For their first match of March 2019, the women of the United States women's national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman they were honoring on the back; Samantha Mewis chose the name of Hamm.[177]
In 2021, Hamm was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[178]
In 2022, Los Angeles F.C. of Major League Soccer - of which Hamm is part owner - won the MLS Cup, thus giving Hamm an MLS championship to her credit
