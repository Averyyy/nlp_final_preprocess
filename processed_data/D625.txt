The Big Bang Theory is an American comedy television series created and executively produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady for CBS. Like the name of the series itself (with the exception of the first episode "Pilot"), episode titles of The Big Bang Theory always start with "The" and resemble the name of a scientific principle, theory or experiment, whimsically referencing a plot point or quirk in that episode.
During the course of the series, 279 episodes of The Big Bang Theory aired, between September 24, 2007, and May 16, 2019. There is also an earlier pilot, that differs greatly from the series, that never aired on CBS.
