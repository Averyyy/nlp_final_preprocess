Set of elements in any of some sets
 Union of two sets:
 
A
 
B
{\displaystyle ~A\cup B}
 Union of three sets:
 
A
 
B
 
C
{\displaystyle ~A\cup B\cup C}
 The union of A, B, C, D, and E is everything except the white area.
In set theory, the union (denoted by  ) of a collection of sets is the set of all elements in the collection.[1] It is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other. 
A nullary union refers to a union of zero (
0
{\displaystyle 0}
) sets and it is by definition equal to the empty set.

Union of two sets[edit]
The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B.[2]  In set-builder notation,
A
 
B
=
{
x
:
x
 
A
 or 
x
 
B
}
{\displaystyle A\cup B=\{x:x\in A{\text{  or  }}x\in B\}}
.[3]
For example, if A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} then A   B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.  A more elaborate example (involving two infinite sets) is:
A = {x is an even integer larger than 1}
B = {x is an odd integer larger than 1}
A
 
B
=
{
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
 
}
{\displaystyle A\cup B=\{2,3,4,5,6,\dots \}}
As another example, the number 9 is not contained in the union of the set of prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} and the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}, because 9 is neither prime nor even.
Sets cannot have duplicate elements,[3][4] so the union of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Multiple occurrences of identical elements have no effect on the cardinality of a set or its contents.
Algebraic properties[edit]
See also: List of set identities and relations and Algebra of sets
Binary union is an associative operation; that is, for any sets 
A
,
B
,
 and 
C
,
{\displaystyle A,B,{\text{ and }}C,}
A
 
(
B
 
C
)
=
(
A
 
B
)
 
C
.
{\displaystyle A\cup (B\cup C)=(A\cup B)\cup C.}
Thus, the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity: either of the above can be written as 
A
 
B
 
C
.
{\displaystyle A\cup B\cup C.}
 Also, union is commutative, so the sets can be written in any order.[5]
The empty set is an identity element for the operation of union. That is, 
A
 
 
=
A
,
{\displaystyle A\cup \varnothing =A,}
 for any set 
A
.
{\displaystyle A.}
 Also, the union operation is idempotent: 
A
 
A
=
A
.
{\displaystyle A\cup A=A.}
  All these properties follow from analogous facts about logical disjunction.
Intersection distributes over union
A
 
(
B
 
C
)
=
(
A
 
B
)
 
(
A
 
C
)
{\displaystyle A\cap (B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)}
 
and union distributes over intersection[2]
A
 
(
B
 
C
)
=
(
A
 
B
)
 
(
A
 
C
)
.
{\displaystyle A\cup (B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C).}
The power set of a set 
U
,
{\displaystyle U,}
 together with the operations given by union, intersection, and complementation, is a Boolean algebra.  In this Boolean algebra, union can be expressed in terms of intersection and complementation by the formula
A
 
B
=
(
A
c
 
B
c
)
c
,
{\displaystyle A\cup B=\left(A^{\text{c}}\cap B^{\text{c}}\right)^{\text{c}},}
where the superscript 
c
{\displaystyle {}^{\text{c}}}
 denotes the complement in the universal set 
U
.
{\displaystyle U.}
Finite unions[edit]
One can take the union of several sets simultaneously.  For example, the union of three sets A, B, and C contains all elements of A, all elements of B, and all elements of C, and nothing else. Thus, x is an element of A   B   C if and only if x is in at least one of A, B, and C.
A finite union is the union of a finite number of sets; the phrase does not imply that the union set is a finite set.[6][7]
Arbitrary unions[edit]
The most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets, sometimes called an infinitary union. If M is a set or class whose elements are sets, then x is an element of the union of M if and only if there is at least one element A of M such that x is an element of A.[8] In symbols:
x
 
 
M
 
 
A
 
M
,
 
x
 
A
.
{\displaystyle x\in \bigcup \mathbf {M} \iff \exists A\in \mathbf {M} ,\ x\in A.}
This idea subsumes the preceding sections for example, A   B   C is the union of the collection {A, B, C}. Also, if M is the empty collection, then the union of M is the empty set.
Notations[edit]
The notation for the general concept can vary considerably.  For a finite union of sets 
S
1
,
S
2
,
S
3
,
 
,
S
n
{\displaystyle S_{1},S_{2},S_{3},\dots ,S_{n}}
 one often writes 
S
1
 
S
2
 
S
3
 
 
 
S
n
{\displaystyle S_{1}\cup S_{2}\cup S_{3}\cup \dots \cup S_{n}}
 or 
 
i
=
1
n
S
i
{\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{n}S_{i}}
.  Various common notations for arbitrary unions include  
 
M
{\displaystyle \bigcup \mathbf {M} }
, 
 
A
 
M
A
{\displaystyle \bigcup _{A\in \mathbf {M} }A}
, and 
 
i
 
I
A
i
{\displaystyle \bigcup _{i\in I}A_{i}}
. The last of these notations refers to the union of the collection 
{
A
i
:
i
 
I
}
{\displaystyle \left\{A_{i}:i\in I\right\}}
, where I is an index set and 
A
i
{\displaystyle A_{i}}
 is a set for every 
i
 
I
{\displaystyle i\in I}
. In the case that the index set I is the set of natural numbers, one uses the notation 
 
i
=
1
 
A
i
{\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}}
, which is analogous to that of the infinite sums in series.[8]
When the symbol " " is placed before other symbols (instead of between them), it is usually rendered as a larger size.
Notation encoding[edit]
In Unicode, union is represented by the character U+222A   UNION.[9] In TeX, 
 
{\displaystyle \cup }
 is rendered from \cup and 
 
{\displaystyle \bigcup }
 is rendered from \bigcup.
