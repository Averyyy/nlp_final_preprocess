Content[edit]
"Just a Dream" is a ballad backed by an acoustic guitar, drum kit, bass guitar and a  string section. The song chronicles an 18-year-old woman going to the church in her wedding dress, with the listener believing she's going to her wedding. However, as the song goes on, it's revealed that she's actually going to the funeral of her husband, who was a soldier killed in action. During the funeral, she wishes that everything going on at the moment is all "just a dream." The woman is eventually given a folded up flag, which is only given to the next of kin, which includes spouse, blood relative or someone who has been granted permission by the courts to be their next of kin.[4]
Writing and inspiration[edit]
Songwriters Steve McEwan, Hillary Lindsey and Gordie Sampson composed the song over the space of a few days in collaborative songwriting sessions in Nashville.[5] According to McEwan, in an interview with HitQuarters, it was Lindsey that first conceived the concept of the song,
"Hillary had this thing in her head,  Wouldn t it be great to write a song about a woman where you think through the song that she s getting married but then you suddenly realise she s actually going to her husband s funeral.  That s how it started."[5]
McEwan refutes the notion that there was a deliberate political subtext to the song and instead insists their primary aim was simply to write something 'heartfelt'.[5] The trio were nevertheless conscious of political interpretation having rejected the earlier title of "American Dream" for making the song "overly political".[5]
Critical reception[edit]
"Just a Dream" was well-received and garnered several positive reviews from critics.
Matt C. of Engine 145, a country music blog, gave the song a "thumbs up" review, calling it one of the best performances of Underwood's in an album that otherwise contained "bombastic vocals".[4] Although he said that the first verse was written in a convoluted fashion ("a swing and a miss by the writers"), he also thought that Underwood's vocal performance compensated enough to make the song viable.[4]
Country Universe reviewer Kevin J. Coyne also gave a favorable review of the single, opining that it "illustrates just how bone-chillingly good a vocalist [Underwood] is when the material is on level with her talent."[6] The single was also ranked number fourteen on the blog's countdown for the Top 40 best country music singles of 2008.[7]
Billboard gave it a positive review as well: "The fourth single from Carrie Underwood's double-platinum Carnival Ride finds the singer charting new territory. Previous singles have stuck to a similar lyrical theme, contrasting between Underwood's girl-next-door image with inspirational or family-centered songs  'Just a Dream' delivers the heartbreaking, storytelling side of Nashville with the kind of song usually reserved for vets like one of her idols Reba McEntire or Martina McBride. Underwood convincingly sells the story of a young widow of a soldier killed in combat, using shades of her emotive vocal to convey anger and despair. While the subject matter is sensitive in this day and time particularly for flag-waving country pundits it is rooted in reality. Add Underwood's adoration by the format's listeners and there is bound to be an immediate and receptive response to this beautifully executed song."[8]
Music video[edit]
The music video was released in August 2008, and was Underwood's final video to be directed by Roman White. It begins with Underwood sitting with her boyfriend Jonathan Roberts, played by Jeff Kasser, an officer in the military, in a car listening to Eddy Arnold's "Make the World Go Away", and trying not to talk about the inevitability of him leaving for war. As she imagines what it would be like to walk down the aisle and marry him, Underwood's smile and white dress transform into a black mourning dress and tears as she walks down the aisle to her husband's coffin; submerged with scenes of Underwood receiving news of his death. It ends with a still shot of Underwood at the casket with flag in hand panning out to reveal a sunny, breezy landscape.[9]
