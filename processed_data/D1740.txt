Kristen Mary Jenner (n e  Houghton / ho t n/ HOH-t n, formerly Kardashian; born November 5, 1955) is an American media personality, socialite, and businesswoman. She rose to fame starring in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007 2021).
She has four children from her first marriage to lawyer Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo  and Robert, and two children from her second marriage to television personality and retired Olympic Games medalist Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn): Kendall and Kylie.
Early life
Jenner was born in San Diego, California, on November 5, 1955, the elder of two children born to Mary Jo "M. J." Shannon (n e Campbell; born 1934), who owned a children's clothing store, and Robert True "Bob" Houghton (1931 1975), an engineer.[1][2][3][4] When she was seven years old, M. J. and Bob divorced, and she and her younger sister, Karen Casey (n e Houghton; born 1958), were raised by their mother. M. J. would eventually remarry, to businessman Harry Shannon (1926 2003), who helped raise her and Karen. By her mother's marriage to Harry, she gained a half-brother, Steven "Steve" Shannon.[5]
Three months after moving to Oxnard, California, Shannon's business partner allegedly left with all the company's capital, so the family moved back to San Diego.[6] In San Diego, Jenner worked at Shannon & Company, a children's clothing store that belonged to her mother.[7] Jenner attended Clairemont High School[8] and graduated in 1973.[9] In 1975, Jenner lost her biological father Robert Houghton in a car crash at nineteen years old.[10] She worked for American Airlines as a flight attendant for a year in 1976.[11]
Television career
Keeping Up with the Kardashians

Jenner met with Ryan Seacrest in 2007 to pursue a reality television show based on her family. Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show The Osbournes in his mind. Jenner further commented on the possible series:[12]
Like, there's the little girls, and there's the older girls, and then there's my son. [...] Everybody thinks that they could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about. It would be natural.

Other ventures
Business
Jenner runs her own production company, Jenner Communications, which is based in Los Angeles. Since before the start of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, she has managed her daughters' Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall, and Kylie's career. She also is involved with the business management of her other daughters and son.
Jenner opened a children's boutique in 2004 with her eldest daughter, Kourtney. The boutique was called "Smooch" and was open for almost six years before closing down in 2009.[13][24] In 2011, Jenner launched a clothing line, Kris Jenner Kollection with QVC.[25][26] Jenner had previously sold exercise equipment with QVC in the 1990s.[27] In April 2020, Jenner teamed up with daughter Kim to launch a perfume collaboration titled KKW x Kris.[28][29]

Public image
Jenner has often been referred to as the "matriarch" of the family.[32][33] Dimitri Ehrlich of Interview magazine called her "the matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner brood" and the "21st century's preeminent female pop-cultural brand-builder."[34] Jenner explained her operations as a businesswoman in her memoir Kris Jenner...And All Things Kardashian: "I started to look at our careers like pieces on a chessboard...Every day, I woke up and walked into my office and asked myself, 'What move do you need to make today?' It was very calculated. My business decisions and strategies were very intentional, definite and planned to the nth degree."[26]
Jenner has been featured on the covers of numerous lifestyle and fashion magazines, including CR Fashion Book,[35] Redbook, Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar,[36] The Hollywood Reporter, Es Magazine, Variety,[37] New You,[38] Haute Living,[39] WSJ. Magazine[40] and Stellar.[41]
Personal life
Marriages, relationships, and family
Main article: Kardashian family
Jenner's first marriage was to lawyer Robert Kardashian (who later became widely known for his early legal representation of O. J. Simpson) on July 8, 1978.[42][43] They have four children: daughters Kourtney (born 1979), Kim (born 1980), Khlo  (born 1984), and son Rob (born 1987). They divorced in March 1991 but remained close friends until his death from esophageal cancer in 2003.[44]
In 2012, Jenner confessed that she had an affair with former soccer player and animator Todd Waterman during her marriage to Kardashian. She referred to Waterman as "Ryan" in her autobiography, but he revealed his identity on his own. They had an encounter on Keeping up with the Kardashians while Kris was having a tennis lesson.[45]
In April 1991, one month after her divorce from Kardashian, Jenner married her second spouse, retired Olympian Bruce Jenner, who publicly came out as a transgender woman in 2015, taking the name Caitlyn.[46] They have two daughters together: Kendall (born 1995) and Kylie (born 1997);[47] in her autobiography, Jenner explained that she named her daughter Kendall Nicole after the late Nicole Brown Simpson.[48] By marriage to Bruce, Jenner also had four stepchildren: Burt, Cassandra "Casey", Brandon, and Brody.
The Jenners announced their separation in October 2013,[49][50] and on September 22, 2014, Kris filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[51] The divorce became final on March 23, 2015, because of a six-month state legal requirement.[52][53] Jenner described the breakup with Caitlyn as "the most passive-aggressive thing", saying that while she had known of Caitlyn's use of hormones in the 1980s, "there wasn't a gender issue. Nobody mentioned a gender issue."[54]
Jenner has ten grandchildren.[55] She has been in a relationship with Corey Gamble since around 2014.[56]
O. J. Simpson trial
Further information: O. J. Simpson murder case

She was portrayed by American actress Selma Blair in the FX limited series American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson, which premiered in February 2016.[58]
