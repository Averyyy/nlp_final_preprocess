Il Divo (Italian pronunciation: [il  di vo]; transl. "The Star") are a multi-national classical crossover vocal group. The male quartet, which originated in the United Kingdom in December 2003,[1] consists of tenors Urs B hler, David Miller, and S bastien Izambard. It also included baritone Carlos Mar n before his death from COVID-19 in December 2021. Il Divo was created and promoted by Simon Cowell for the label Syco Music (a subsidiary of Sony Music).
As of 2021, the group released ten studio albums: Il Divo (2004), The Christmas Collection (2005), Ancora (2005), Siempre (2006), The Promise (2008), Wicked Game (2011), A Musical Affair (2013), Amor & Pasi n (2015), Timeless (2018), and For Once in My Life: A Celebration of Motown (2021); as well as a compilation album, The Greatest Hits (2012). Two other albums   An Evening with Il Divo: Live in Barcelona (2009) and Live in Japan (2014)   presented recordings of live concerts. The group has also collaborated with other artists.
Since its inception, Il Divo has enjoyed success worldwide, selling over 30 million copies of their albums worldwide.[2] With 160 certified gold and platinum hits in 35 countries, the group has pioneered the genre of operatic pop, or "popera", in classical crossover music.
Il Divo's live concerts sold over two million concert tickets worldwide just from the group's first four albums. In its first world tour, concerts in 69 cities in 18 countries were sold out.[3]
Members[edit]
Il Divo was composed of four singers, three of whom are classically trained, from four countries:[4] baritone Carlos Mar n; two classically trained tenors, Urs B hler and David Miller; and pop singer-songwriter S bastien Izambard.
Conception and name[edit]
The idea behind Il Divo came when Simon Cowell, inspired after listening to the Three Tenors, decided to form a multinational quartet of talented young singers to recreate the quality of Luciano Pavarotti, Jos  Carreras, and Placido Domingo. Cowell searched worldwide for young singers who were willing to embark on the project from January 21, 2001, to December 16, 2003, when Miller was signed.[5] Prior to Il Divo, each member enjoyed moderate success individually.[6]

Artistry[edit]
Styling[edit]
Besides music, the members of Il Divo are also known for their refined and elegant appearance, wearing almost exclusively suits by Giorgio Armani[77] (Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Collezioni).[78]
Il Divo is a powerful and fascinating presence, in these years have been a great inspiration for me. I remember the first time I saw them performing live: I was impressed by their elegance and their fascinating way to communicate emotions through his music orig.[79] Giorgio Armani
Il Divo's style is so elegant, it describes our music. It's a dress in the style of the Rat Pack which was composed of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.[80] Carlos Mar n
Musical style[edit]
Il Divo changed the genre of opera with their musical combination of opera singing and classical music, with themes of different genres, including Latin, folk, ballads, church music, bolero and pop.[81]
Multilingual[edit]
Il Divo records their songs in several languages: Spanish ("Regresa A M ", "Hasta Mi Final", "La Vida Sin Amor"), English ("Mama", "Amazing Grace", "Don't Cry For Me Argentina"), Italian ("Senza Parole", "Passera", "Notte Di Luce"), French ("Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore", "Le Temps des Cathedrales"), Latin ("Panis Angelicus"), Portuguese ("Volta Pra Mim"), and Japanese ("Furusato").[82][83] Some songs incorporate more than one language in the same song, such as "The Man You Love" (Spanish and English), "Ave Maria" (Italian and Latin), and "I Believe In You" (English & French), whereas others are recorded in a single language, but sung live in two languages: "She" (Italian & English) and "Bring Him Home" (English & Spanish).
Most of the songs that they cover are reinterpreted from English and translated into the Spanish language, as the group have said that "Spanish is the language of Romanticism".[84]
Other activities[edit]
Philanthropy[edit]
On 25 April 2007, Il Divo performed on American Idol in one of the "Idol Gives Back" episodes, which raised money for children in the US and Africa. For every vote cast during that show, Idol sponsors Coca-Cola, AT&T, and others donated money to the Charity Projects Entertainment Fund and other groups such as Save the Children and America's Second Harvest.[85]
In 2011, they recorded "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" to raise money for the organisation Save the Children.[86]
Il Divo is related indirectly in terms of sponsorship and help with the French NGO SMTA Assistance M dicale Toit du Monde since 2005, of which Izambard is the international official sponsor, and with Sanfilippo Children's Foundation, for which Izambard is the global ambassador.[87][88]
Between 20 and 30 September 2015, Miller and B hler participated in a motorbike ride from Miami to Los Angeles to raise funds for the Nordoff Robbins music therapy charity.[89]
