The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL NFL World Championship Game (Super Bowl I).
The Super Bowl is the annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The winner receives the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand,[1] usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.[2] Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.
Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were marketed as the "AFL NFL World Championship Game", but were also casually referred to as "the Super Bowl game" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker in official marketing; the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4]
A total of 20 franchises, including teams that have relocated to another city or changed their name, have won the Super Bowl.[5] There are four NFL teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1950, 1954, 1955, 1964) and Lions (1935, 1952, 1953, 1957) had won NFL Championship Games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the 1966 season. 
The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII. Only two franchises have ever won the Super Bowl while hosting at their home stadiums: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV and the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI.

^ a b c d From 1966 to 1969, the first four Super Bowls were "AFL NFL World Championship Games" games played between two independent professional football leagues, AFL and NFL, and when the league merged in 1970 the Super Bowl became the NFL Championship Game.[4]

Consecutive wins
 The Steelers defeated the Rams in Super Bowl XIV to win an unprecedented four championships in six years.
Seven franchises have won consecutive Super Bowls, one of which (Pittsburgh) has accomplished it twice:
Green Bay Packers (Super Bowls I and II)
Miami Dolphins (VII and VIII)
Pittsburgh Steelers (twice: IX and X; XIII and XIV)
San Francisco 49ers (XXIII and XXIV)
Dallas Cowboys (XXVII and XXVIII)
Denver Broncos (XXXII and XXXIII)[n 1]
New England Patriots (XXXVIII and XXXIX)
No franchise has ever won three Super Bowls in a row. Several franchises have had eras of sustained success, nearly accomplishing a three-peat:
The Green Bay Packers won the first two Super Bowls, and also won the NFL Championship Game the preceding year. If the Super Bowl had been instituted that year, the Packers would have qualified and faced the Buffalo Bills of the AFL.
The Miami Dolphins appeared in three consecutive Super Bowls (VI, VII, and VIII)  winning the last two, and coming within one win of three consecutive Super Bowl titles.
The Dallas Cowboys won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXVII and XXVIII); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game, two wins short of a three-peat, by the eventual Super Bowl XXIX champion San Francisco 49ers. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX the following year for three wins in four seasons, and thus were two wins away from four consecutive Super Bowl titles.
The Kansas City Chiefs made three Super Bowls in four years, winning LIV and LVII, while losing LV. In the intervening year, they lost the 2021 AFC Championship Game to the Cincinnati Bengals in overtime, coming one win short of four consecutive appearances. Additionally, in the year prior to their victory in LIV, the Chiefs likewise lost the 2018 AFC Championship Game to the New England Patriots in overtime, resulting in being two wins short of five consecutive appearances.
The New England Patriots won Super Bowls XLIX, LI, and LIII for three wins in five seasons. They also appeared in and lost Super Bowl LII to the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2017 season, giving them four Super Bowl appearances in five years and putting them one win away from three consecutive Super Bowl titles. Moreover, in the intervening year, were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game by the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos. In total, then, the Patriots were three wins away from five consecutive Super Bowl appearances.
The Pittsburgh Steelers won two consecutive Super Bowls (IX and X); the following season they were eliminated in the AFC Championship Game, two wins short of a three-peat, by the eventual Super Bowl XI champion Oakland Raiders. They also won two more consecutive Super Bowls (XIII and XIV) for four wins in six seasons.
The San Francisco 49ers won two consecutive Super Bowls (XXIII and XXIV); the following season they were eliminated in the NFC Championship Game, two wins short of a three-peat, by the eventual Super Bowl XXV champion New York Giants.
Consecutive losses
Three franchises have lost consecutive Super Bowls:
Buffalo Bills (4) (Super Bowls XXV, XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII)   The only team to appear in four straight Super Bowls; they lost in all four appearances.
Minnesota Vikings (2) (VIII and IX)   They also lost Super Bowl XI, and were knocked out of the 1975 76 playoffs by the eventual Super Bowl X losers, the Dallas Cowboys, for three losses in four seasons.
Denver Broncos (2) (XXI and XXII)   They also lost Super Bowl XXIV, but did not qualify for the 1988 89 playoffs for Super Bowl XXIII for three losses in four seasons.[n 1]
Consecutive appearances
The Buffalo Bills have the most consecutive appearances with four from 1990 to 1993.

^ a b The Seahawks and Buccaneers each began play in 1976. For scheduling purposes, the Seahawks were placed in the NFC and the Buccaneers were placed in the AFC for their first year of play. In 1977, the two teams switched conferences, placing the Seahawks in the AFC and the Buccaneers in the NFC. In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC. Neither the Seahawks nor Buccaneers have played in the Super Bowl representing the AFC.
 The New England Patriots played their first championship game in Super Bowl XX (pictured) where they lost to the Bears. This is the most recent Super Bowl where both teams had their first Super Bowl appearance. The Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances (11) and are tied for both most wins (6, tied with the Steelers) and most losses (5, tied with the Broncos).
Teams with no Super Bowl appearances or long active droughts
 The Jets' last championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III.
Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl (shown in bold below). Two of them (Jacksonville and Houston) joined the NFL relatively recently, and there are an additional eight teams whose Super Bowl appearance droughts began prior to 2002 (the year Houston joined the NFL).  The other two teams that have never appeared in a Super Bowl (Cleveland and Detroit) both held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season[n 7].  Teams are listed below according to the length of their current Super Bowl droughts:
Cleveland Browns, 57 years   NFL champions four times in 1950, 1954, 1955, and 1964; appeared in seven other NFL Championship Games in 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1965, 1968, and 1969; and appeared in three AFC Championship Games in the 1986, 1987, and 1989 seasons.[82] The Browns are officially viewed as one continuous franchise that began in 1946 as a member of the All-America Football Conference, joined the NFL in 1950, suspended operations after 1995, and resumed play in 1999.[83][n 6]
Detroit Lions, 57 years   NFL champions four times in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957; appeared in one other NFL Championship Game in 1954; and appeared in one NFC Championship Game in the 1991 season.[84]
New York Jets, 54 years   Won Super Bowl III, 1968 season[85][n 8]
Minnesota Vikings, 46 years   Lost Super Bowl XI, 1976 season
Miami Dolphins, 38 years   Lost Super Bowl XIX, 1984 season
Washington Commanders, 31 years   Won Super Bowl XXVI, 1991 season (played as Washington Redskins)
Buffalo Bills, 29 years   Lost Super Bowl XXVIII, 1993 season
Los Angeles Chargers, 28 years   Lost Super Bowl XXIX, 1994 season (played as San Diego Chargers)
Jacksonville Jaguars, 27 years   1995 expansion team; AFC Championship Game appearances in the 1996, 1999, and 2017 seasons.[86]
Dallas Cowboys, 27 years   Won Super Bowl XXX, 1995 season
Tennessee Titans, 23 years   Lost Super Bowl XXXIV, 1999 season
Houston Texans, 20 years   2002 expansion team; Divisional Round appearances in the 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2019 seasons. They are the only NFL team to never reach the Conference Championship Round.
Teams with Super Bowl appearances but no victories
Eight teams have appeared in the Super Bowl without ever winning. In descending order of number of appearances and then years since their last appearance, they are:
Minnesota Vikings (4)   appeared in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX, and XI; they won the NFL Championship in 1969, the last year before the AFL NFL merger, but failed to win the subsequent Super Bowl. An NFL expansion team in 1961, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.
Buffalo Bills (4)   XXV, XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII; in 1964 and 1965, they won the last two AFL Championships before the first Super Bowl in 1966.
Cincinnati Bengals (3)   XVI, XXIII, and LVI; an AFL expansion team in 1968, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.
Carolina Panthers (2)   XXXVIII and 50; a post-merger expansion team, their first season was in 1995.
Atlanta Falcons (2)   XXXIII and LI; an NFL expansion team in 1966, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.
Los Angeles Chargers (1)   XXIX as the San Diego Chargers; their only AFL Championship was in 1963, also as the San Diego Chargers.
Tennessee Titans (1)   XXXIV; they won the first two AFL Championships in 1960 and 1961 as the Houston Oilers.
Arizona Cardinals (1)   XLIII; their only uncontested NFL Championship was in 1947 as the Chicago Cardinals. They also claim the 1925 NFL Championship.

Explanatory notes
^ a b c d The Broncos are the only NFL team with both consecutive wins and consecutive losses at the Super Bowl.
^ The New York Jets and Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (Super Bowl III) is the only Super Bowl matchup that cannot be repeated under the current playoff alignment, as the Colts have since been placed in the AFC (at the time, along with all of the former AFL teams, including the Jets) as part of the AFL NFL merger in 1970. For the same reason, it is the only Super Bowl rematch that is capable of being played in the postseason outside of the Super Bowl.
^ The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills are the only NFL teams to face each other in consecutive Super Bowls, XXVII and XXVIII.
^ This is the only rematch pairing in which one team has relocated in the interim. The Rams represented St. Louis in Super Bowl XXXVI and Los Angeles in Super Bowl LIII.
^ a b c d Three NFL franchises, the Colts, Steelers, and Browns, were placed in the newly-formed AFC, joining the ten extant AFL franchises, when the two leagues merged in 1970. The Colts are the only team to have qualified for the Super Bowl for both the "National" and "American" sides.
^ a b c Although the 1995 Cleveland Browns became the 1996 Baltimore Ravens, the Browns' name, brand and history remained in Cleveland and was continued by the 1999 Cleveland Browns; the Ravens, for historical purposes, are considered a separate franchise.
^ Detroit, Houston, and Jacksonville have all hosted Super Bowls, making Cleveland the only current NFL city that has neither hosted nor had its team play in a Super Bowl.
^ The Jets and the Chiefs are the only non-NFL teams to win the Super Bowl, both being members of the now-defunct AFL at the time. The Jets have not appeared in the Super Bowl since joining the NFL following the AFL NFL merger in 1970.

History of the NFL Championship
1   Dates in the list denote the season, not necessarily the calendar year in which the championship game was played. For instance, Super Bowl LIV was played in 2020, but was the championship for the 2019 season.
2   From 1966 to 1969, the first four Super Bowls were "World Championship" games played between two independent professional football leagues, AFL and NFL, and when the league merged in 1970 the Super Bowl became the NFL Championship Game.
3   Italics indicate future games.
