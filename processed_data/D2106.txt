Storylines[edit]
I kinda feel like there will be some downward spiral in a way for Naomi's character, but she's good at covering, so she'll still have that facade.
 AnnaLynne McCord on what fans can expect to see from Naomi in season 3 after being attacked by Mr Cannon.[27]
The third season of 90210 welcomed the students of West Beverly Hills High School to their senior year with a surprising new family and the destruction of another. Adrianna's pop career blossomed and a new love will caused the fall out of a group of friends. An earthquake hit Beverly Hills in the premiere. "We wanted to open the season with an event that has both physical and emotional ramifications for several people," said co-executive producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who added that the tremors would prove particularly life-altering for one teen. "One of them has a very serious injury that takes time to resolve and sort of changes the direction of his or her life."[28] It was revealed during the summer of 2010 that either Liam, Navid, or Teddy would come out as gay in season 3.[29] Co-executive producer, Jennie Urman said of that matter, "We want to address the issue in a real and relatable way."[29] The character was later revealed as Teddy.[30] Silver's bi-polar disorder was revisited after Adrianna tampered with her medication when implementing a plot for revenge.[31] In Season 3, Adrianna also sees a boom in her entertainment career as an aspiring reality TV star, though is eventually driven to desperate ends to keep her show alive, such as the pronouncement that she will be seeking to regain the daughter she once gave up for adoption. TVLine revealed that a major character would find out that she was pregnant in the finale.[32] It was later revealed that Naomi was the character in question. 
Cast[edit]
I finished my stint there and the show is kind of off on its own, and I'm happy to walk away. It was fun, there's a lot of energy. My friend was producing the first season of the new show, and so that was kind of my motivation to be a part of it. And then he left and it just kind of got a little wonky, so I was happy to be a part of it in the beginning.
