However, before making their decisions, Cassie and Charles decide to get married and the Sutton and Antoni families race to the ceremony.

Main[edit]
Edward "Eddie" Sutton (Russell Hornsby) is a police officer who moves his family back to his old neighborhood hoping to make a difference.

It's revealed that his mother was killed twenty years ago when he was thirteen, making him thirty-three at the series debut. The age of his oldest daughter implies he and Jenn were teen parents, which is supported later on when it's learned Jenn was about Cassie's age when she married Eddie. This would've made him even younger when his oldest, Nate, with his old flame, Dana Taylor, was born.
Jennifer "Jenn" Sutton (Nicki Micheaux) is Eddie's wife who is a nurse. She is the daughter of a judge and she is against the family's current location. Despite her own concerns on this, she stays with her husband and puts her medical skills to good use.

She starts not to trust Charles after the earthquake/Mac's death, fighting with people who are racists. She goes with Charles to meet his father after these events.

When she enters high school, she becomes friends with a boy named Andrew while working at an after-school volunteer program.
