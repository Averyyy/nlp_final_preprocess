This is a list of deities and legendary figures found in Etruscan mythology.
The names below were taken mainly from Etruscan "picture bilinguals", which are Etruscan call-outs on art depicting mythological scenes or motifs. Several different media provide names. Variants of the names are given, reflecting differences in language in different localities and times.
Many of the names are Etruscan spellings (and pronunciations) of Greek names. The themes may or may not be entirely Greek. Etruscans frequently added their own themes to Greek myths. The same may be said of native Italic names rendered into Etruscan. Some names are entirely Etruscan, which is often a topic of debate in the international forum of scholarship.
Deities[edit]
Deity
Description
Achlae
Greek river god Achelous.[1]
Achvizr, Achuvesr, Achuvizr, Achviztr

aiser
general term for gods.[4]
aiser si
gods of light.[4]
aiser seu
gods of darkness.[4]

Etruscan goddess, whose name is identical to Etruscan "willingly".[2]
Aminth
Etruscan winged deity in the form of a child, probably identified with Amor.[5]
Ani
Divinity named on the periphery of the Piacenza Liver as dominant in that section. It seems to correspond to Martianus Capella's Templum I, north, ruled by Janus, for which Ani appears to be the Etruscan word.[6]
Apulu, Aplu
The god Apollo.[5]
Apru
Alternate Etruscan spelling of Aphrodite. See Turan.[7]

Aritimi, Artumes

Calu
Etruscan infernal god of wolves, represented by a wolf.[8] Associated with Tinia, Selvans, and Suri.[9]
Catha, Cavtha, Cath
An Etruscan deity, god and goddess, not well represented in the art. She appears in the expression ati cath, "Mother Cath"[10] and also maru Cathsc, "the maru of Cath". The nature of the maru is not known. She is also called  ech, "daughter,"[11] which seems to fit Martianus Capella's identification of the ruler of Region VI of the sky as Celeritas solis filia, "Celerity the daughter of the sun." In the Piacenza Liver the corresponding region is ruled by Cath.[12] van der Meer considers Cautha/Cavtha/Cavatha to be a separate deity from Cath(a), the former being a kind of Aurora or "eye of the sun" as well as an underworld deity who is paired with Suri (see below).[13]
Cel
Etruscan earth goddess, probably identified with Ge, as she had a giant for a son. Her name occurs in the expression ati Cel, "Mother Cel."[10]

Laran
Etruscan god of war.[21]
Lasa
One of a class of deities, plural Lasas, mainly female, but sometimes male, from which the Roman Lares came. Where the latter were the guardians of the dead, the Etruscan originals formed the court of Turan. Lasa often precedes an epithet referring to a particular deity: Lasa Sitmica, Lasa Achununa, Lasa Racuneta, Lasa Thimrae, Lasa Vecuvia.[21]
Lasa Vecuvia
Goddess of prophecy, associated with the nymph Vegoia.[21] See under Bego .

Letun
The goddess known to the Greeks as Leto.[21]

Mania
Etruscan infernal deity, forming a dyad with Mantus.[26] She went on into Latin literature, ruling beside Mantus and was reported to be the mother of the Lares and Manes.[27] Under the Etruscan kings, she received the sacrifices of slain children during the Laralia festival of May 1.[28]
Mantus
Etruscan infernal deity, one of a dyad including Mania.[26] A tradition of Latin literature[29] names the Etruscan city of Manthua, later Mantua, after the deity.[19]
Mari 
A class of divinity used with epithets: mari  turans, mari  husurnana, mari  menitla, mari  halna, mari  isminthians. The appearances in art are varied: a man, a youth, a group of babies cared for by Menrva.[25] The Roman god, Mars, is believed to have come from this name. Pallottino refers to the formation of a god by "... fusing groups of beings ... into one." Of Mars he says "... the protecting spirits of war, represented as armed heroes, tend to coalesce into a single deity, the Etrusco-Roman Mars, on the model of the Greek god Ares."[30] But L. Bonfane writes: "Mari  is not Mars, but a local divinity who, according to one interpretation, lived for the considerable period of 130 years, and had three lives."[31] The roots of the Italic god end in a -t, while no such ending is visible in the Etruscan form, which instead has in -i not seen in the Italic forms.
Mean, Meanpe
Etruscan deity, equivalent of Nike or Victoria.[25]
Menerva, Menrva
The Etruscan original to the Roman Minerva, made into Greek Athena.[25]

Orcus
Etruscan god of the underworld, punisher of broken oaths. He was portrayed in paintings in Etruscan tombs as a hairy, bearded giant.
Pacha
Roman Bacchus, an epithet of Fufluns.[32]
Pemphetru
Greek Pemphredo, one of the Graeae.[15]
Phersipnai, Phersipnei, Persipnei, Proserpnai
Queen of the underworld, equivalent to the Greek Persephone and Roman Proserpina.[15]

Prumathe

Satre
Etruscan deity, source of, or derived from, the Roman god Saturn.[37]
Selvans
God who appears in the expression Selvansl Tularias, "Selvans of the boundaries", which identifies him as a god of boundaries. But also Selvans Calusta (see Calus above).[9] The name is either borrowed from the Roman god, Silvanus or the original source of the Roman god's name.[38]
Sethlans
Etruscan blacksmith and craftsman god, often wielding an axe. Equivalent to the Greek Hephaistos and Roman Vulcanus.[38]
Summanus
Etruscan god of nocturnal thunder, often said to be Zeus's twin or opposite.
Suri,  uri
An oracular, chthonic Apollo, probably corresponding to Faliscan Soranus/D s Pater.[39]

Tecum
God of the lucomenes, or ruling class.
Thalna, Thalana, Talna
Etruscan divine figure of multiple roles shown male, female, and androgynous. They attend the births of Menrva and Fufluns, dance as a Maenad and expound prophecy. In Greek   "to bloom". A number of divinities fit the etymology: Greek Thallo and Hebe, and Roman Iuventas, "youth."[40][41]
Thanr
An Etruscan deity shown present at the births of deities.[40]
Thesan
Etruscan goddess of the dawn. She was identified with the Roman Aurora and Greek Eos.[40]
Thetlvmth
Unknown deity of the Piacenza Liver, which is not a picture bilingual.[42]
Thufltha
Unknown deity of the Piacenza Liver, which is not a picture bilingual.[42]
Tinia, Tina, Tin
Chief Etruscan god, the ruler of the skies, husband of Uni, and father of Hercle, identified with the Greek Zeus and Roman Jupiter well within the Etruscan window of ascendance, as the Etruscan kings built the first temple of Jupiter at Rome. Called apa, "father" in inscriptions (parallel to the -piter in Ju-piter), he has most of the attributes of his Indo-European counterpart, with whom some have postulated a more remote linguistic connection.[43] The name means "day" in Etruscan. He is the god of boundaries and justice. He is depicted as a young, bearded male, seated or standing at the center of the scene, grasping a stock of thunderbolts. According to Latin literature, the bolts are of three types: for warning, good or bad interventions, and drastic catastrophes.[44] Unlike Zeus, Tin needs the permission of the Dii Consentes (consultant gods) and Dii Involuti (hidden gods    Graeae?) to wield the last two categories. A further epithet, Calusna (of Calu), hints at a connection to wolves or dogs and the underworld.[44]
Tiur, Tivr, Tiv
Etruscan deity identified with Greek Selene and Roman Luna (goddess).[45]
Tlusc, Tluscv, Mar Tlusc
Unknown deity of the Piacenza Liver, which is not a picture bilingual.[42][46] The corresponding region in Martianus Capella is ruled by Sancus, an Italic god and Sabine progenitor, who had a temple on the Quirinal Hill, and appears on an Etruscan boundary stone in the expression Selvans Sanchuneta, in which Sanchuneta seems to refer to the oaths establishing the boundary. Sancus probably comes from Latin sanc re, "to ratify an oath."[47]
Turan
Etruscan goddess identified with Greek Aphrodite and Roman Venus. She appears in the expression, Turan ati, "Mother Turan", equivalent to Venus Genetrix.[48] Her name is a noun meaning "the act of giving" in Etruscan, based on the verb stem Tur- 'to give.'
Turms, Turm 
Etruscan god identified with Greek Hermes and Roman Mercurius. In his capacity as guide to the ghost of Tiresias, who has been summoned by Odysseus, he is Turms Aitas, "Turms Hades."[48]
Turnu
An Etruscan deity, a type of Eros, child of Turan.[48]
TV[?]th
Unknown deity of the Piacenza Liver, which is not a picture bilingual.[42]
Uni
Supreme goddess of the Etruscan pantheon, wife of Tinia, mother of Hercle, and patroness of Perugia. With Tinia and Menrva, she was a member of the ruling triad of Etruscan deities. Uni was the equivalent of the Greek Hera and the Roman Juno, from whose name the name Uni may be derived.
Usil
Etruscan deity identified with Greek Helios, Roman Sol.[45]
Vea
Etruscan divinity, possibly taking its name from the city of Veii or vice versa.[49]
Veltha, Velthume, Vethune, Veltune
Etruscan deity, possible state god of the Etruscan league of Etruria, the Voltumna in the Latin expression Fanum Voltumnae, "shrine of Voltumna", which was their meeting place, believed located at Orvieto. The identification is based on reconstruction of a root *velthumna from Latin Voltumna, Vertumnus, and Voltumnus of literary sources, probably from Etruscan veltha, "earth" or "field". Representations of a bearded male with a long spear suggest Velthune may be an epithet of Tinia.[50]
Veiove, Veive, Vetis
Etruscan infernal deity whose temple stood at Rome near the Capitoline Hill.[49] The identification is made from the deity's Latin names related by a number of ancient authors over the centuries: V i, V di, V dii, Veiovis, Vediovis, Vediiovis, Vedius.[51]
Vesuna
Italic goddess mentioned also in the Iguvine Tables.[49]
