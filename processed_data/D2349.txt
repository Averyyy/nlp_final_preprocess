Japanese keyvisual of the series
Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, a manga by Clamp, has been adapted into four different anime versions between 2005 and 2009, including a two-season anime television series, an anime film, and two original video animation (OVA) series with screenplay provided by Nanase Ohkawa and music composed by Yuki Kajiura. Bee Train adapted the manga series into a fifty-two-episode anime entitled Tsubasa Chronicle directed by K ichi Mashimo with Hiroshi Morioka joining on as co-director for season two. Hiroyuki Kawasaki scripted both seasons.[1] Production I.G adapted the manga series into both an anime film entitled Tsubasa Chronicle the Movie: The Princess of the Country of Birdcages directed by Itsuro Kawasaki and two OVA adaptations directed by Shunsuke Tada entitled Tsubasa Tokyo Revelations and Tsubasa Shunraiki. Set in a fictional universe involving alternative realities, the story follows a group of five travellers Syaoran, Sakura, Kurogane, Fai D. Flourite, and Mokona as they search for fragments of Sakura's memory that take the form of feathers of great power and without which, Sakura will die. The series features much crossover with its sister series xxxHolic, another manga by Clamp.
The first season of the anime series aired on NHK between April 9, 2005 and October 15, 2005 spanning twenty-six episode.[2] The anime film aired in Japanese theaters on August 20, 2005. The second season of the anime series aired on NHK between April 29, 2006 and November 4, 2006 spanning twenty-six episodes.[3] The first OVA was released between November 16, 2007 and March 17, 2008 spanning three episodes.[4] The second OVA was released between March 17, 2009 and May 15, 2009 spanning two episodes.[5]
The two seasons of the anime series were dubbed by the anime television network Animax under the title Chronicle of the Wings and later began broadcast on April 6, 2006 across its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia as well as its other networks in Taiwan and Hong Kong.[citation needed] Funimation Entertainment licensed both seasons of the anime for English-language release in North America under the name Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle.[6] Funimation has also released the first season of the anime in the United Kingdom through Revelation Films.[7] Revelation Films had confirmed the release of the second season of Tsubasa Chronicle in the U.K. but no release dates were ever confirmed.[8]
