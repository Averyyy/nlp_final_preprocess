The Duramax V8 engine is a family of 6.6 liter diesel V8 engines produced by DMAX, a joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu in Moraine, Ohio. The Duramax block and heads are supplied from reliable vendors of General Motors. This engine was initially installed in 2001 Chevrolet and GMC trucks, and has since become an option in pickups, vans, and medium-duty trucks. In 2006, production at Moraine was reportedly limited to approximately 200,000 engines per year.[1] On May 9, 2007, DMAX announced the production of the 1,000,000th Duramax V8 at its Moraine facility,[1] followed by the 2,000,000th on March 24, 2017.[2]
Engine RPO Codes[edit]
LB7[edit]
RPO LB7 (engine code "1") was first introduced in 2001 and continued until early-2004. It is a 32-valve design with high-pressure common-rail direct injection and an experimental composite design cylinder head.
The following trucks use the LB7:
Chevrolet Kodiak/GMC Topkick
Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra HD
Specifications[edit]
Block / Head: Cast Iron / Aluminum
Compression: 17.5:1
Injection: Direct; Bosch high pressure common-rail
Power / Torque: 300 hp (224 kW) at 3,100 rpm 520 lb ft (705 N m) at 1,800 rpm
The LLY was introduced in 2004 and replaced the LB7 completely mid-year
LLY[edit]
The LLY (internally called the 8GF1) (engine code "2") is a 6.6 L; 403.9 cu in (6,619 cc) turbocharged engine which debuted in mid-2004 and continued until the end of 2005 (except the Hummer H1 in 2006). It is a 32-valve design with high-pressure common-rail direct injection and aluminum cylinder heads. The LLY was GM's first attempt to implement emissions requirements on their diesel trucks. To meet this goal, they turned to a newly developed Garrett turbocharger with a variable geometry vane system and installed an EGR Valve. Learning from problems with injectors in the previous LB7, GM changed the valve covers to allow access to the injectors without having to remove the valve covers, saving significant labor costs if injector replacement became necessary.
The following trucks used the LLY engine:
2006-only Hummer H1 Alpha
Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra HD
Specifications[edit]
[3]
Block / Head: Cast gray iron / Cast aluminum
Compression: 17.5:1
Injection: Bosch High Pressure Common-rail
Power / Torque: 310 bhp (231 kW) at 3000 rpm / 520 lb ft (705 N m) at 1600 rpm
Head casting is 8gf1
Block casting is #22351021213
LLY/LBZ[edit]
There are two VIN codes for the LBZ. The first is VIN 2 produced in late 2005 and early 2006. The VIN 2 engine is mechanically and physically the same as the VIN D engine but utilizes LLY engine tuning due to the LBZ tuning taking longer to be EPA certified and placed into production.
The second is VIN D. This was introduced in 2006 and continued into 2007 sold only in the "classic" body style. It has an improved engine computer tune that produces increased power and torque over the 2005 LLY version of the engine. First appearance of the Duramax in the Express/Savana vans. The LBZ is one of the more sought after Duramax engines due to its strength, reliability, and being pre-emissions (DPF appeared on the next generation LMM in 2007).
Changes include:
Cylinder block casting and machining changes strengthen the bottom of the cylinder bores to support increased power and torque
Upgraded main bearing material increases durability
Revised piston design lowers compression ratio to 16.8:1 from 17.5:1
Piston pin bore diameter increased for increased strength
Connecting rod   I   section is thicker for increased strength
Cylinder heads revised to accommodate lower compression and reduced cylinder firing pressure
Maximum injection pressure increased from 23,000 psi (1,585.8 bar) to more than 26,000 psi (1,792.6 bar)
Fuel delivered via higher-pressure pump, fuel rails, distribution lines and all-new, seven-hole fuel injectors
Fuel injectors spray directly onto glow plugs, providing faster, better-quality starts and more complete cold-start combustion for reduced emissions
Improved glow plugs heat up faster through an independent controller
Revised variable-geometry turbocharger is aerodynamically more efficient to help deliver smooth and immediate response and lower emissions
Air induction system re-tuned to enhance quietness
EGR has larger cooler to bring more exhaust into the system
First application of new, 32-bit E35 controller, which adjusts and compensates for the fuel flow to bolster efficiency and reduce emissions
LBZ applications:
Chevrolet Silverado HD
Chevrolet Kodiak
GMC Sierra HD
GMC TopKick
LLY applications:
Chevrolet Silverado HD
Chevrolet Kodiak
GMC Sierra HD
Chevrolet Express full-size (reduced power output mated to a 4L85E transmission)
GMC Savana full-size (reduced power output mated to a 4L85E transmission)

LGH[edit]
The 6.6L Duramax diesel engine (VIN code "L") is used on 2010 interim and 2011 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans and 2011 Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra HD trucks with RPO ZW9 (chassis cabs or trucks with pickup box delete). The LGH engine is rated at 335 bhp (250 kW) at 3100 rpm and 685 lb ft (929 N m) at 1600 rpm. Similar to the LML this engine also uses a DPF and DEF system to meet emission standards.
LML[edit]
The 6.6L RPO LML (VIN code "8") is the 2011 2016 version of the Isuzu/GM Duramax V8 diesel engine. It is a further advanced version of the LMM engine with the majority of the changes addressing a required drastic reduction in engine emissions. Some mechanical aspects of the engine, such as piston oil flow design for improved temperature control and oil pump design, were also improved to enhance durability even further.
The LML engine was significantly updated for 2011 to provide improved exhaust emissions that comply with the new federal emission standards for diesel engines, provide better engine rigidity and further noise reduction. New 29,000 PSI piezo injectors, a complete fuel system-hardening to tolerate up to 20% biodiesel mixtures and urea injection (to reduce nitrogen oxides) with a 5.3 gallon urea tank are updating the fuel and emissions systems. This engine has a fuel injector in the exhaust tract, to allow raw fuel injection during the particulate filter recycling routine. The RPO LML engine is rated at 397 hp (296 kW) at 3000 rpm and 765 lb ft (1,037 N m) of torque at 1600 rpm.[9]
L5P[edit]
The L5P Duramax is the latest version of the Duramax V8 diesel engine.(engine code Y) Introduced in the 2017 model year it is the most powerful diesel engine GM has produced with 445 hp (332 kW) at 2,800 rpm and 910 lb ft (1,234 N m) at 1,600 rpm. Design spec performance can exceed 550 bhp (410 kW) at 3050 rpm and 1,050 lb ft (1,424 N m) at 1975 rpm.
L5D[edit]
The L5D Duramax is a downrated version of the L5P for the Chevy Silverado MD and International CV trucks (Class 4, 5, and 6). The L5D was downrated to increase reliability and reduce downtime. The L5D was introduced in 2018 for the 2019 model year Chevy Silverado MD and International CV trucks. Specifications for the L5D are 350 hp (261 kW) at 2600 RPM and 700 lb ft (949 N m) at 1600 RPM.
