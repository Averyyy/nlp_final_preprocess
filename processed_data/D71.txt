Unknown
  Peru
Lina Medina, from the Ticrapo District of Peru, gave birth by cesarean section in Lima at age 5+1 2. The infant was a 2.69 kg (5.9 lb), 47.5 cm (18.7 in) boy named Gerardo. Medina's parents, who thought their daughter had a tumor, took her to a hospital, where she was then found to be 7 months pregnant when she was about 5 years and 6 months old. She gave birth 1+1 2 months later. By interrogating her parents, the doctors understood that Medina had entered into precocious puberty (when hormone glands are activated earlier than normal) very early after her birth.[1][2][3][4][5] Medina's father was arrested on suspicion of sexual abuse, but was later released due to lack of evidence, and the baby's biological father was never identified.[1][4]

She had secondary sexual characteristics and menstruation since the age of 4. The pregnancy proceeded without complications. Medical concilium of Kharkiv Obstetric and Gynecological Clinic decided to take a natural birth, leaving the option of caesarean section in case of complications during childbirth. Childbirth began July 10, 1931. Early of July 11 the fetus died due to prolapse of the umbilical cord loop, after which the fetus was removed under general anesthesia with the help of instruments. Dead female fetus 50 cm long, weighing 3 kg; general development was normal, post-mortem examination revealed underdevelopment of the thyroid and thymus. L. P. had passed postpartum period without complications. She regained regular menstruation.[7] Her further fate is unknown.
