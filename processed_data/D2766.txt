The history of glassmaking in Jablonec region has been written since the 14th century.  In 1711 the Fisher brothers brought the secrets of crystal cutting and polishing to North Bohemia. During the 19th century, Jablonec nad Nisou became the world center of jewelry industry. In 1724, the first factory specialized in manufacturing and export of crystal chandeliers was established in Pr che  near Kamenick   enov. Bohemian chandeliers were ordered for the Royal Courts Versailles and Fontainebleau palaces of Louis XV, Sultan Osman III of the Ottoman Empire, and Empress Elizabeth of Russia.  In 1743 Czech master craftsmen created a marvelous chandelier in honor of the coronation of Empress Maria Theresa which still bears her name. 
The development of jewelry and glass companies, which were established and prospered in North Bohemia at the turn of the 19th century, was interrupted by World War II.
In 1945 the seven main crystal factories and 18 small firms in and around Jablonec nad Nisou merged, forming the Preciosa company. Preciosa was officially established on April 10, 1948.[2]
During the Communist era (1948 1989) the history of the Preciosa company became one of close collaboration with the oppressive institutions of the Communist regime. In the period from the 1960s to the 1980s, Preciosa became an integral part of the notorious Minkovice labour camp (V znice Minkovice) set up by the Communist government in 1958 and now known as one of the most brutal Communist prison camps in Czechoslovakia: it was nicknamed by prisoners  The Red Hell  or  Minkau  (after the Nazi concentration camp in Dachau).[3][4][5] There are credible testimonies, by a number of political prisoners held in the camp in the 1980s, of prisoners being severely physically abused by some of the guards, including the notorious Josef Vondru ka, to the point of torture; with the abuse resulting in permanent damage to the prisoners' health and, at least on one occasion, in the death of a prisoner.[6][7][8]
According to a number of testimonies, Minkovice prisoners were forced to work in the Preciosa factory under inhuman conditions, suffering from lack of food, lack of breaks, unbearable heat, toxic work environment made worse by the lack of medical care, and they were constantly facing impossible work demands linked to threats of brutal punishment for failing to fulfil them, such as being held in concrete isolation cells for days and sometimes weeks.[9][10] The profits of the Preciosa company under the Communist regime were thus due largely to the Communist prisoners' slave labour.
After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, in a less than transparent privatization process of the formerly state-owned enterprise,[11] Preciosa was gradually bought up by Ludv k Karl, the Communist era manager of the company who personally benefited from the brutal exploitation of the Minkovice prisoners.
In 1993, the company Lustry Kamenicky Senov Inc., the largest Czech manufacturer of chandeliers and lighting fixtures became a daughter company Preciosa Chandeliers, Inc.
In 1995  the subsidiary company Preciosa Figurky, Ltd. was formed in the Preciosa Group.[12]
In 2009, the Jablonex Group divisions Glass and Beads joined in Preciosa Group as the new company Preciosa Ornela Inc.
Nowadays, Preciosa Group associates the following companies: Preciosa Inc.,  Preciosa Chandeliers Inc., Preciosa Figurines Ltd. and Preciosa Ornela Inc.
Public activities[edit]
Preciosa is the main shareholder of the Czech football club FC Slovan Liberec.[13] Preciosa was an official national partner of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 and designed and made crystal trophies received by winners together with medals.[14]
