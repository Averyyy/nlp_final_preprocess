 House of Representatives member pin for the 112th U.S. Congress
The 112th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, from January 3, 2011, until January 3, 2013. It convened in Washington, D.C. on January 3, 2011, and ended on January 3, 2013, 17 days before the end of the presidential term to which Barack Obama was elected in 2008. Senators elected to regular terms in 2006 completed those terms in this Congress. This Congress included the last House of Representatives elected from congressional districts that were apportioned based on the 2000 census.[1][2]
In the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican Party won the majority in the House of Representatives. While the Democrats kept their Senate majority, it was reduced from the previous Congress.[3]
This was the first Congress in which the House and Senate were controlled by different parties since the 107th Congress (2001 2003), and the first Congress to begin that way since the 99th Congress (1985 1987).[citation needed] It was also the first Congress since the 36th Congress, over 150 years, in which the Republican Party held the House but not the Senate. In this Congress, the House of Representatives had the largest number of Republican members, 242, since the 80th Congress (1947 1949).[4] This was the only Congress between the 79th (1945 1947) and the 117th (2021 2023) that did not include a member of the Kennedy family.
As of 2022, this is the most recent Congress in which Democrats held a Senate seat in Nebraska or a House seat in Arkansas, the last in which Republicans held both Senate seats in Maine, and the last in which Democrats did not hold all seats in Connecticut.

Potential government shutdown[edit]

 US government shutdown averted in last-minute deal
A failure to pass a 2011 federal budget nearly led to a shutdown of non-essential government services on April 9, 2011, with the furlough of 800,000 government employees appearing imminent.[10] President Obama met Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner in the days preceding the deadline but was unable to come to an agreement to pass a budget.[citation needed] A one-week budget was proposed to avoid a government shutdown and allow more time for negotiations; however, proposals from both parties could not be accommodated.[citation needed] Obama said he would veto a proposed Republican budget over Republican social spending cuts.[citation needed] This was also backed by Senate Democrats who objected to such cuts as that of Planned Parenthood.[11][12][13] However, an agreement was reached between the two parties for a one-week budget to allow for more time to negotiate after Republicans dropped their stance on the Planned Parenthood issue.[12] The two parties ultimately agreed on a 2011 federal budget the following week.[citation needed]
There were many reactions to the possible shutdown with some saying the economy could be hurt during a fragile recovery[14] and others saying the lack of an unnecessary bureaucracy would not be noticed.[15] There was also criticism that while senators and representatives would continue to get paid others such as the police and military personnel would either not be paid for their work or have their payments deferred.[16]
Debt limit crisis[edit]

Main article: United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011
On August 2, 2011, the United States public debt was projected to reach its statutory maximum.  Without an increase in that limit the U.S. Treasury would be unable to borrow money to pay its bills.  Although previous statutory increases have been routine, conservative members of the House refused to allow an increase without drastically reducing government spending.  Over several weeks and months, negotiators from both parties, both houses, and the White House  worked to forge a compromise.  The compromise bill, the Budget Control Act of 2011, was enacted on August 2.
