NBA Finals
1968 
The 1967 NBA World Championship Series was the championship series of the 1966 67 National Basketball Association (NBA) season, and was the conclusion of the 1967 NBA Playoffs. The best-of-seven series was played between the Western Division champion San Francisco Warriors and the Eastern Division champion Philadelphia 76ers. This was the first championship series in 11 years without the Boston Celtics, who were defeated in the Division Finals by Philadelphia, the first time since 1958 and the only time in the 1960s that the Boston Celtics did not win the NBA Finals.
Despite dominating the regular season with a 68 13 record (the most regular season wins in NBA history at the time) the 76ers did not have an easy time of it against the Warriors. Ultimately, the 76ers won the series over the Warriors, 4 2.[1]
